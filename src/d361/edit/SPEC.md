# A Human-Friendly Python Package for Document360: `d361util`

This document outlines the design and specification for a Python package, `d361util`, built on top of the auto-generated `d361api` package.  The goal of `d361util` is to provide a simplified, user-friendly interface for interacting with a Document360 knowledge base, abstracting away the complexities of the raw API and presenting a filesystem-like structure for managing articles and categories. This will allow users to easily synchronize local Markdown files with their Document360 cloud storage.
