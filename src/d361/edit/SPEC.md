# A Human-Friendly Python Package for Document360: `d361util`

This document outlines the design and specification for a Python package, `d361util`, built on top of the auto-generated `d361api` package. The goal is to provide a simplified interface for interacting with Document360 knowledge bases, abstracting away API complexities and presenting a filesystem-like structure for managing articles and categories. Users can synchronize local Markdown files with their Document360 cloud storage.
