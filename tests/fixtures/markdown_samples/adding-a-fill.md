In Vexy Lines, a "fill" is the magic that transforms your reference image into vector art. Think of fills as different patterns of lines that follow the contours and details of your image. Each fill type creates a unique artistic style, giving you endless creative possibilities!

## Customizing Your Fill

After adding a fill, the real fun begins! Let's customize it to create exactly the look you want:

1. Select your fill by clicking on it in the Layers panel
2. Look at the Properties panel (usually on the right side of your screen)

3. You'll see various settings you can adjust - these change depending on which fill type you chose
4. Try moving the sliders to see how each setting affects your artwork:
   - **Interval**: Controls how close together the lines are placed
   - **Angle**: Changes the direction of the lines
   - **Thickness**: Makes the lines thinner or thicker
   - **Other settings**: Will vary based on your fill type

Watch in real-time as your adjustments transform your artwork! The preview updates instantly, so you can easily see what works.

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple**: Use just one fill type until you're comfortable with how it works
- **Experiment with settings**: Small changes to intervals and thickness can create dramatically different looks
- **Layer fills**: Once you're comfortable, try adding multiple fill types to create complex artwork
- **Use the "Reset" button**: If you make adjustments you don't like, look for the reset button next to each setting
- **Save versions**: If you find a setting combination you love, save your document before making more changes

## Common Questions

**"Why doesn't my fill look right?"**  
Your reference image might be too complex. Try a simpler image first, or adjust the interval and thickness settings.

**"How do I make my artwork look more detailed?"**  
Try reducing the interval setting to create more lines, or experiment with the Trace fill type for detailed edges.

**"Can I combine different fill types?"**  
Absolutely! Many artists use multiple fill types layered together to create rich, complex artwork.
