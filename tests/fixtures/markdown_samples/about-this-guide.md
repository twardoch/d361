This user guide is updated continuously. Everybody should read the interface overview article, particularly to learn about how to manipulate FontLabâ€™s panels and dialogs, and how we differentiate between tapping versus holding keys for tools keyboard shortcuts.

The first chapters show how to use FontLab 7. They are sorted in the best learning order, but you can use the links to consult the manual in any order. The last chapters are references that describe all tools and commnads, interface controls, and also typographic terms and technologies.

At the end of this manual, you will find a collection of tutorials. While the core manual explains how to use FontLab 7, the tutorials show how to get given results. They explain solutions and show ideas you may be not aware of. We plan to add more tutorials.

Check the list of all Keyboard Shortcuts and also instructions about Customizing Shortcuts.
