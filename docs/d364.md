Each tab supports text, images, tables, links, callouts, code, and other enhancements. Tabs require at least two, with a maximum of ten.

### Content Organization: Categories and Subcategories

Document360 categories and subcategories are organizational tools that structure articles into logical groups, improving user navigation and accessibility. Categories represent broad topics, while subcategories provide more specific divisions. They can be customized, including renaming and changing icons, and articles can be assigned to multiple categories. Best practices include clear naming, logical hierarchy, and user-centric organization. Access permissions can be applied, and categories can be reordered. Visibility issues may arise if articles are unpublished or absent; troubleshooting includes checking browser settings and cache. Proper structuring enhances knowledge base usability and user experience.

### Content Organization: Creating a Category

Document360 allows category creation via four methods: top-bar "Create", "Flywheel", "More" icon, and within a Folder/Index. Fill in name, nesting level, and type (Folder, Index, Page, or GitHub), then click "Create". Favor a maximum of 3 subcategory levels for optimal navigation. Alternative content finding tools include tags, search, and related articles.

### Content Organization: Changing Category Icons

To customize category icons in a knowledge base, navigate to the Documentation section, select the desired folder/index category, search for/browse emojis, choose one, and confirm. Emoji selection isn't possible for "Page" type categories.

- Benefits: well-organized, accessible knowledge base for teams and users.

### Content Organization: Hiding and Unhiding Categories

Document360 allows restricting team access to categories and subcategories within documentation. Hidden items are marked, and users can hide/unhide using the "More" menu in categories/folders/index. Hiding one category hides everything under it. Four methods are described for hiding/unhiding in various contexts (single items, groups, folders, etc.), through the navigation menus and visual aids.

### Content Organization: Renaming a Category

Document360 allows renaming categories within the knowledge base via two methods: directly on the category page or via the "More" menu. This action doesn't change the category's URL slug; simply update the displayed name.

### Content Organization: Deleting a Category

There are four methods to delete categories in the Knowledge base portal:

1. **Categories & Articles section**: Hover over the category, click **More** > **Delete**, then confirm.
2. **Folder/Index category**: In the desired category, click **More** > **Delete**, then confirm.
3. **Multiple articles/subcategories**: Select checkboxes, click **Delete**, confirm.
4. **Specific article/subcategory**: Hover, click **More** > **Delete**, confirm.

**Note**: Deleting a root category removes all subcategories and articles, stored in the recycle bin for 30 days.

### Content Organization: Cloning a Category

Clone categories in Document360 by selecting the "More" then "Clone" option on your target category or item within a category. Choose target workspace/category, optionally update linked files automatically. Security restrictions apply depending on destination. Three methods are available: in the main category list, within a folder/index, or on a specific article/subcategory in a folder/index.

### Content Organization: Understanding Category Types

Categories and subcategories in Document360 serve as organizational tools to group similar articles, resembling folders for related content. The document references a comparison table for Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans, though specific details in the table are unspecified.

### Content Organization: Starring a Category

To unstar, either click the Star icon again or remove them from the Starred section by selecting checkboxes and clicking "Remove from starred." The Starred section acts like a favorites list, enhancing navigation efficiency.

### Content Organization: Moving a Category

You can move a category or subcategory across workspaces using 5 methods:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag the category within the same workspace.
2. **More Icon in Categories & Articles**: Use the More icon to access the Move option and select a destination.
3. **More Icon in Folder/Index**: Similar to Method 2 but initiated from within a specific folder.
4. **Move Multiple Items**: Select multiple articles/subcategories and use the Move icon.
5. **Move Specific Item**: Use the More icon on a specific item within a folder.

**Key Considerations**: Moving affects all subcategories/articles; cannot move root categories into subcategories; link updating is recommended when moving across workspaces.

### Content Organization: Drive Folder Mapping

**Drive folder mapping** automatically places images uploaded by contributors to articles into specific Drive folders based on the article's category and subcategory.

### Content Organization: Types of Categories

Three category types for organizing a Document360 knowledge base: **Folder** (container for articles/subcategories, no URL), **Index** (generates a URL, lists articles with details), and **Page** (functions like an article with content creation). Categories can be switched anytime without data loss.

### Content Organization: Linking Drive Folders

To link a Drive folder to a Document360 category, navigate to the category, click "More" (•••), "Set drive folder," select the desired folder, and click "Update." Subcategory mappings take precedence over parent mappings for image uploads. Changes only affect new images.

### Content Organization: Category-Drive Mapping

Enterprise versions likely offer enhanced automation and management features.

### Content Export: Downloading Categories and Articles

This feature allows users to export entire categories and articles into PDFs with customizable templates. It is exclusive to private projects and workspaces. Enable the "Download as PDF" button in Settings > Knowledge base site > Article settings. Users can select templates during export. Note the 500 MB daily limit, with options to purchase additional capacity. Customization in the KB site does not affect PDFs, and visibility settings may restrict export options.

### Content Creation: Creating an Article

Document360 users can create articles via four methods: a top-bar "Create" button, "Flywheel" icon, "More" icon, or "Create" button within folders/indexes. Article creation involves navigating to the Documentation section, naming the article, and selecting the category. Plan-based article limits exist (Professional: 5,000; Business: 5,000; Enterprise: 10,000).

- Auto-update links adjust references to the new location.

### Content Import: Importing Word Files

Document360 allows importing Word (.docx) files as either a single article or multiple articles based on headings. Single article imports the whole document. Multiple articles create new articles for each H1 (and optionally H2, etc.) heading within the file. Media and hyperlinks are preserved during the import.

### Content Import: Troubleshooting Word Imports

When the errors `documentation.categoriesAndArticles.maxArticlesCountReached` or `documentation.categoriesAndArticles.articleLimitExceedsPerCategory` occur, it indicates that the article limit for a category or project has been exceeded. This typically happens when creating many articles, bulk importing, or adding subcategories. **Steps to resolve:** Check if the issue affects all categories, verify the plan limits (100 articles per category; 5,000 per workspace for Pro/Business, 10,000 for Enterprise). Reduce articles or upgrade the plan if needed. If unresolved, contact Document360 Support.

An image overview of the error message is available in the document.

### Content Publishing: Publishing from the Editor

Verify publication by checking for hidden status, restrictions, and workspace settings ("Public").

### Content Publishing: Publishing Process

The process of making drafted and reviewed articles available to end-users. Key plans for publishing include:

- **Professional**: Basic customization and SEO support.
- **Business**: Advanced audience targeting and analytics.
- **Enterprise**: Premium features like custom domains and multi-language support.

### Content Import: Choosing Editors for .docx Import

The editor used for importing .docx files is determined by selections in the Knowledge base portal settings. To configure this, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > General > Editor**, and choose between Markdown, WYSIWYG, or Advanced WYSIWYG editors. Note that Markdown does not support .docx imports.

Best practices include splitting large documents into multiple articles for efficiency and ensuring files are under 15MB. Troubleshooting common errors involves addressing issues like TOC header conflicts, firewall blocks, password-protected files, and style mismatches between Word and Google Docs. Additionally, the "maximum articles" error can be resolved by adjusting heading tags to reduce article count during import.

### Content Management: All Articles Overview

Document360's new "All articles" feature allows for bulk actions on multiple articles and page categories. Actions include publishing, previewing, copying links, hiding, moving, deleting, setting reminders, checking status, tagging, translation, PDF download, deprecating. This streamlines article management, especially for large-scale operations such as product launches.

### Localization: Machine Translation Prerequisites

Machine translation requires credits. Check your balance in Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Machine translation. Purchase more if needed. Credits are consumed at a rate of one per translated character.

### Localization: Using Machine Translation

Two methods for machine translation exist: bulk translation of multiple articles via the "All articles" section (involving WYSIWYG editor switch) or for individual articles from within the editor. Both involve setting the translation status. Retranslating is required if the main language article is updated.

### Localization: AI Machine Translation Overview

Document360's AI machine translation enables seamless localization of content, with benefits including time efficiency, consistency, and scalability. Key points include automatic conversion from Markdown to WYSIWYG and specific behaviors regarding article deletion vs. hiding.

To customize the Eddy AI, go to **Settings () > AI features > Customization**. On the **Customize Eddy AI** page, you can:

1. **Rename the AI**: Enter a desired name (up to 15 characters) in the **AI assistant name** field.
2. **Adjust Response Tone**: Choose from options like Default, Professional, Friendly, Casual, or Straightforward to match your preferred style.
3. **Set Response Length**: Select between Default, Long and detailed, or Short and concise for varying levels of detail.

Once done, click **Save**. Note: The AI name is subject to moderation checks; override if prompted.

**TL;DR**: Personalize Eddy AI by renaming it, adjusting tone, and response length via the customization page.

### Localization: Translation Status Indicators

Multilingual knowledge base articles have translation status indicators (🌐 for "Needs translation") above formatting tools. Filtering by "Needs translation" or "Translated" in the Knowledge Base portal allows users to locate and update translation status, including machine translation. The main language article doesn't show status.

### Localization: Troubleshooting Machine Translation

- **Large articles:** Split articles exceeding 50,000 characters (HTML) into smaller sections for translation.
- **Content updates:** Manually trigger updates in secondary languages using the "Machine translation" feature in the "All articles" section. New content doesn't automatically update.
- **Supported languages:** Machine translation supports many languages (list provided).
- **Character limit:** Be mindful of the 50,000 character limit and potential error messages.
- **Reversibility:** Translating changes the article status, but the original content is not recoverable. Backups are recommended.
- **Costs:** Machine translation is included in the subscription, but excessive character counts may incur additional charges.
- **Language management:** Deleting or hiding articles in one language affects the main and other language versions. Changing/Adding languages isn't automatic, requiring specific actions.

### Localization: Machine Translation Examples

Document360 offers two machine translation methods. **Scenario 1** allows translating existing English articles to other languages (e.g., German, Spanish) via the "All articles" section, requiring selection, confirmation, and automated translation. **Scenario 2** involves adding a new language (e.g., French) post-content creation; English articles are replicated but must be translated manually. If languages were added before content creation, manual translation from "All articles" is needed. The timing of language addition affects content replication and translation requirements.

To manage machine translation credits effectively, start by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Machine translation** to monitor your project's usage. The dashboard includes Limit (total credits), Usage (consumed credits), Remaining (leftover credits), and Usage meter (percentage used). Note that individual articles must be under 50,000 characters, including formatting; split larger articles if necessary. Subscription plans determine credit limits: Professional (1M), Business (2M), and Enterprise (5M). Additional credits can be purchased in 1M increments for $50.

Machine translation credits are managed via the settings portal, with metrics for limit, usage, remaining, and usage percentage. Articles must be under 50k characters, including formatting. Subscription tiers set limits (Professional: 1M, Business: 2M, Enterprise: 5M), with options to buy additional 1M credits for $50.

.article-header .article-back-icon {
  display: none;
}
.search-container {
  display: none !important;
}
```

3. **Add Custom JavaScript**: In the Custom JavaScript tab, add the following code to ensure the search container is hidden after a delay and to handle any dynamic loading:

### Localization: Customizing Localization Variables

Localization variables enable tailored text across a Knowledge Base portal, ensuring language-specific experiences. Access via Settings > Knowledge Base Portal > Localization & Workspaces > Localization Variables. Edit by selecting a language, updating variables in accordion sections (e.g., Eddy AI, Accessibility), and saving changes. Key details: updates may take up to 15 minutes due to caching, and each language requires manual updates. Examples include customizing "Search" or "In this article" labels.

### Content Organization: Understanding Workspaces

Document360 Workspaces enable organizations to create and manage multiple distinct knowledge bases within a single project, catering to diverse audiences or documentation needs. This feature helps organize content tailored to specific users or product areas, ensuring documentation remains organized, accessible, and relevant, regardless of complexity.

### Content Organization: Workspace Benefits

Workspaces enhance productivity by ensuring relevant information is accessible to specific audiences, improving content organization, and facilitating team collaboration through structured areas for peer reviews and feedback.

### Content Organization: Getting Started with Workspaces

Document360 automatically creates a default workspace ("v1") upon project creation. Using multiple workspaces streamlines documentation, targeting information for specific users (internal teams and customers), and improves access to relevant content.

### Content Organization: Workspace Use Cases

- **Product-specific documentation:** Organize knowledge bases for multiple SaaS products within a single project, using separate workspaces to maintain clear boundaries for each product.
- **Audience-specific documentation:** Create dedicated workspaces for different user roles (e.g., developers, end-users, administrators) to provide relevant content and avoid confusion.
- **Internal and external knowledge bases:** Separate workspaces for internal (e.g., support teams) and external (e.g., customers) documentation, enabling access control and clear content separation.

### Content Organization: Troubleshooting Workspace Issues

404 errors navigating secondary workspaces often stem from the workspace being private, lacking published articles, or hidden articles. Ensure the workspace is public, at least one article is published, and visible within the knowledge base. Workspace status directly impacts visibility and the availability of 'Main workspace' options. The document also covers workspace management, recovery, and display options. Subscription tiers (Free, Professional, Business, Enterprise) affect the quantity of available workspaces and associated features (e.g., backup/restore).

### Billing: Purchasing Additional Workspaces

To purchase additional workspaces:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Knowledge base portal** > **Localization & Workspaces** > **Localization & Workspaces**.
2. Click the **buy more** link (available only to users with the Owner role).
3. Adjust the number of workspaces in the **Purchase add-on** window and review the **Amount due**.
4. Confirm payment and await confirmation; workspaces will be added upon successful payment.
5. Download your invoice after payment.

Additional workspaces can also be purchased through the Billing section in Document360 settings.

### Data Management: Backup and Restore

Document360 automatically backs up projects daily at 00:00 UTC. Manual backups are also possible. You can restore documentation, API docs, homepage builder, custom CSS & JavaScript to a previous state. Lost/altered content can be recovered from the latest backup.

### Data Management: Restoring from Backup

To restore from a backup, navigate to Settings > Knowledge Base Portal > Backup & Restore. Select the desired backup and the elements (documentation, API, Homepage, CSS, JS) you want to restore. Compare Custom CSS/JS versions before restoring. Click "Restore," confirm, and wait for the "Backup restored" message.

### Content Organization: Adding New Workspaces

To create a new workspace, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Localization & Workspaces**, then click **Add workspace**. Choose the workspace type, enter a name (max 30 alphanumeric/hyphen characters), and customize the URL. Select a status: Main (default, public), beta, public, or deprecated. Option to create a new workspace or copy existing content, including specific categories and link handling. Configure languages with options for default, display name, right-to-left scripts, and visibility. Finish by clicking **Add**.

### Data Management: Creating Manual Backups

To create a manual backup, go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base portal** > **Backup and Restore**, click **New backup**, enter a backup name, and click **Backup**. The backup will be added to the backup log once complete.

### Notifications: Setting Up SMTP Notifications

Configure an SMTP notification channel for your knowledge base portal by navigating to Settings > Knowledge base portal > Notifications > New channel > SMTP. Input a descriptive name, recipient emails (separated by semicolons), and save. Then, map events to trigger email notifications.

### Notifications: Notification Mapping

Document360's notification mapping allows users to configure alerts for updates (documentation, security, analytics) across different user roles (Professional, Business, Enterprise). This facilitates automated updates without manual checking. The table, however, is empty, so there's no specific mapping to summarize.

### Notifications: Mapping Channels to Events

Configure notifications in the knowledge base portal by enabling events (all or specific modules/events), then mapping those events to desired channels (e.g., email). All events are initially off. Specific events like "Analytics weekly mail" can be enabled per module. Each enabled event requires at least one assigned notification channel.

### Notifications: Notification History

Document360's notification history tracks delivery statuses of alerts (e.g., system updates, errors) sent to configured channels (like Slack). This allows teams to monitor delivery, troubleshoot failures, and ensure critical updates are received.

### Notifications: Setting Up Teams Notifications

Setup involves three main steps: creating a Teams channel, obtaining a webhook URL, and configuring it in Document360. For each step:

1. **Create a Teams Channel**: Open Teams, navigate to the desired team, add a new channel named (e.g., "Document360 Notifications").
2. **Get Webhook URL**: In the new channel, manage settings, add an incoming webhook, generate and copy the URL.
3. **Configure in Document360**: Navigate to Notification channels, add a new channel, select Teams, enter a friendly name, paste the webhook URL, and save.

Test the setup by triggering a notification and check the channel for receipt. Use Notification Mapping to customize which events trigger alerts. For multiple channels, repeat the process with different webhooks and map accordingly.

### Notifications: Custom Email Domains

Enterprise users can configure custom email domains for notifications in Document360. Requires configuring MX and TXT records on your DNS provider. Follow steps to add domain, obtain records from Document360, add records to DNS, verify the configuration, and specify the "From" email address and sender name. Verification and troubleshooting are addressed.

### Notifications: Notification Event Types

The document describes notification events across multiple modules, including Documentation editor (e.g., article updates, visibility changes, workflow status), Drive (e.g., folder and file modifications), Knowledge base portal settings (e.g., workspace updates, tag changes), Knowledge site (e.g., feedback and user interaction alerts), AI notifications (e.g., credit usage alerts), Analytics (e.g., weekly metrics), and comments (e.g., inline comment notifications). These events enable users to stay informed about changes and activities within their knowledge base ecosystem.

### API Integration: Postman Integration

Import the Document360 API into Postman using `https://apihub.document360.io/swagger/v2/swagger.json`. Authenticate using a Document360 API token, obtained from Settings > Knowledge Base portal > API tokens. Create a Postman environment variable (`base_URL`) with the API hub URL (`https://apihub.document360.io`). This allows accessing Document360 API endpoints via Postman. Re-authentication might be needed if the Postman session ends.

### Notifications: Managing Notification History

Access notification history by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Notification** and selecting the **Notification history** tab. The history provides details for each notification, including channel name, delivery status, submission date, sent date, and event details. Use the **View details** option to review the content sent to users. This feature allows tracking and verification of notification delivery.

### API Integration: Swagger Documentation

Authenticate with API token. Use `GET` to retrieve, `POST` to add, `PUT` to update, and `DELETE` to remove items. Required fields use underscores (e.g., `email_id`). Proper formatting and usage of the specified API methods are crucial. Authentication is required to use the API. Refresh may end session, requiring re-authentication.

### Search: Full Portal Search

Full portal search allows users to simultaneously search across all project content, files, tags, users, content tools, and settings across all workspaces and languages.

### API Integration: Using Postman

Postman is an API platform that allows users to build and use APIs. It can be easily integrated with a Document360 project, offering both on-premises and web-based access. For guidance, refer to the following resources:

Contact [support](mailto:support@document360.com) if needed.

### Site Configuration: Understanding Subfolder Hosting

Subfolder hosting organizes website content hierarchically within folders under the root domain (e.g., `example.com/docs`). This approach is often preferred over subdomains for SEO reasons. Subfolders are subdirectories that reside beneath the primary website's root domain, improving SEO.

### Site Configuration: Troubleshooting Domain Issues

- **Domain Verification Failed**: Ensure CNAME records match and no duplicate DNS records exist. Use tools like Digwebinterface to verify DNS settings. Some registrars like Cloudflare may mask records.
- **DNS Propagation**: Allow up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate. Check TTL settings if issues persist.
- **CAA Restrictions**: Check for CAA records restricting SSL providers. Add required CAA entries for Digicert, LetsEncrypt, and Google.
- **"This site can't be reached" Error**: Verify DNS configuration, check for duplicate records, and ensure SSL provider CAA entries are present.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Check certificate expiration, browser settings, and DNS resolver configuration. Try accessing via different browsers or without VPN.
- **FAQs**:
- Document360 provides SSL certificates automatically.
- Custom domains reflect in invitation emails.
- Multiple domains per project are not supported.
- Naked domains are those without "www" prefix.
- Domain registrars manage domain purchases and DNS settings.

### Site Configuration: Post-Configuration Steps

Knowledge base site is live on custom subfolder, but needs a redirect from main domain to prevent duplicate content issues with search engines (e.g., `example.com/docs`). Contact Document360 support for this redirect. Configure canonical URL (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`) in knowledge base portal settings to globally indicate preferred URL for search engines. This avoids duplicate content and ensures the correct URL ranks better.

### Site Configuration: Web Server Information

A web server delivers website content (text, images, video, application data) to clients like web browsers. Common web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft IIS, OpenResty, LiteSpeed, and Cloudflare.

### Site Configuration: Enabling Subfolder Hosting

- Enable subfolder hosting by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Custom domain > Subfolder hosting tab** and toggle on the feature. Default path is `/docs`.
- For custom subfolder paths (e.g., `/help`), enter the desired path and click **Update**. Ensure subfolder hosting is enabled and configure languages for your server.
- For **KB site 2.0**, customize the Site API path (e.g., `/docs-api`) in the same tab. Both Subfolder and Site API paths must be defined for proper functionality.

> **Note**: Article preview is not supported for custom domains with subfolder hosting. Site API path is separate from API documentation.

### Site Configuration: Nginx Subfolder Hosting

Nginx is an open-source web server that supports hosting websites in subfolders. For more details, refer to the [**Nginx documentation**](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).

### Site Configuration: Nginx Configuration Resources

Nginx location blocks direct requests to different parts of your web server based on URL patterns. There are selection algorithms that determine which location block to use when matching incoming requests. See external Nginx documentation and tutorials for details about configuring and understanding these algorithms.

### Site Configuration: Nginx Sitemap Proxy

Configure Nginx to proxy sitemap requests to a backend server. Example uses `example.document360.io`, but replace with your domain (e.g., `your-custom-domain.com`). Supports language-specific sitemaps (e.g., `/sitemap.xml.en`). Ensures proper header forwarding for security and tracking.

### Site Configuration: Nginx Post-Configuration

After configuring the web server, your knowledge base is accessible via both your project's existing URL and your custom domain. This may cause duplicate content, so a redirect from the existing Document360 subdomain URL to your custom domain URL is needed. Contact support to implement this redirect.

### Site Configuration: Nginx Subfolder Setup

Configure Nginx by adding location blocks for your desired subdirectory, specifying proxy_pass, headers, and sub_filter directives to rewrite URLs. For multiple workspaces, add separate blocks and redirects. Restart Nginx to apply changes.

### Site Configuration: Nginx Home Page Subfolder

To host a project's home page on a custom subfolder, add Nginx configuration blocks for each workspace. Each block proxies requests to the Document360 domain and sets appropriate headers. Redirects are used for language-specific paths. After updating the configuration, restart Nginx.

**TLDR;** Configure Nginx with exact location blocks for each subfolder, proxy to Document360, set headers, handle redirects, then restart Nginx. Customization of domains, subfolders, and workspaces is required.

### Site Configuration: ASP.NET Core Subfolder Hosting

Host a knowledge base as a subfolder (`/docs`) of your main website using an ASP.NET Core server. Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Proxy` package and configure a proxy to route requests to the knowledge base's actual server (e.g., `example.document360.io`). Define both the subfolder path and the knowledge base's API path if on KB Site 2.0. Replace example domain with your specific Document360 or custom domain.

### Site Configuration: ASP.NET Core Post-Configuration

Duplicate content issue arises after configuring knowledge base in a custom subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/docs`). A redirect from the original site URL (`example.document360.io`) to the new subfolder URL is required. Contact `support@document360.com` to implement this redirect.

### Site Configuration: IIS Subfolder Hosting

Integrate knowledge base into existing website via subfolder (`/help`). Pre-requisites include Application Request Routing and URL Rewrite IIS modules. Replace example domain with your Document360 or custom domain.

### Site Configuration: Troubleshooting Nginx Issues

TLDR of common NGINX setup issues and their solutions:

- **Invalid "location" Directive**: Ensure location blocks are within a server block. Example configuration:

```nginx
server {
listen 80;
server_name example.com;
location /docs {
      proxy_pass https://example.document360.io/docs;
      proxy_set_header Host example.document360.io;
}
}
```

- **Certbot Package Unavailable**: Enable EPEL repository and install Certbot:

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install certbot
```

- **NGINX Configuration Test Failed**: Run `sudo nginx -t`, check error messages, and fix syntax issues. Example correction:

```nginx
## Incorrect
proxy_pas https://example.com;

## Correct
proxy_pass https://example.com;
```

- **SSL Certificate Issue**: Verify certificate with OpenSSL and ensure correct NGINX configuration:

```bash
openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem -text -noout
```

Example configuration:

```nginx
server {
listen 443 ssl;
server_name yourdomain.com;
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
}
```

Each resolution includes essential steps and examples for quick troubleshooting.

### Site Configuration: IIS Post-Configuration

To avoid duplicate content issues, a URL redirect is required from your original project URL (e.g., `yourcompany.document360.io`) to the custom subfolder (e.g., `yourcompany.com/help`). Contact `support@document360.com` to enable this redirect. Using a custom subfolder on your existing domain prevents duplicate content impacting search engine rankings.

### Site Configuration: Web Server Sitemap Proxy

Configure a web server to proxy requests for sitemap.xml files (e.g., `/sitemap.xml.en`), forwarding them to an internal or external server hosting the actual sitemap data. This hides the internal location of the sitemap file. The configuration example uses `example.document360.io` as a placeholder.

### Site Configuration: Subfolder Hosting Next Steps

The knowledge base is now accessible via two URLs (project URL + custom subfolder). To avoid duplicate content issues, a URL redirect (from project URL to custom subfolder) is necessary. Contact support to enable the redirect.

### Site Configuration: IIS Subfolder Setup

To set up a sub-folder path for hosting documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Modules**:

- Install the [URL Rewrite module for IIS Server](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite).
- Install and enable the Application Request Routing (ARR) module.

2. **Configure web.config**: Add the following rewrite rules to your `web.config` file to proxy requests to your documentation:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
<system.webServer>
   <rewrite>
      <rules>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_HomePage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help$" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/v1" />
               <serverVariables>
                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_DocsPage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help/(.*)" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/help/{R:1}" />
               <serverVariables>
                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
      </rules>
   </rewrite>
</system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

**Important Considerations**:

- Backup your `web.config` file before making changes.
- If using KB Site 2.0, ensure you define both the Subfolder path and the Site API path.

### User Management: Reader Self-Registration

Users can independently create reader accounts on knowledge base sites by following a self-registration process. Share the knowledge base URL. Users enter name & email, then verify the email for password set-up. Project members control reader access. Email verification is a one-time process usable across projects.

### User Management: Reader Self-Registration - Plan Availability

The self-registration feature is available for Business and Enterprise plans when the Knowledge base site access is set to Private or Mixed.

### Site Configuration: Apache Subfolder Hosting

The Apache HTTP server is a free, open-source solution offering flexibility and customization for hosting Document360 knowledge bases as subfolders. Key steps include enabling necessary modules (proxy, headers, substitute, etc.), configuring VirtualHost for proxying and URL substitutions, setting up redirects, and restarting the server. Substitutions ensure links reflect the subfolder structure, and redirects manage URL paths seamlessly.

### User Management: Configuring Reader Self-Registration

Enable reader self-registration in Document360 settings to allow users to register themselves. Configure default reader groups and/or restrict access by email domain (allow or block specific domains). Newly registered readers are added to default groups unless their domain is already assigned.

### User Management: Domain Restrictions for Self-Registration

Configure knowledge base self-registration by domain. Specify email domains (allowing or blocking) and assign reader groups to those domains. Domain-specific settings override default reader groups.

### User Management: Creating Reviewer Accounts

Create Reviewer accounts individually by selecting "Reviewer" in the portal role during team account creation. Bulk import is possible by using a CSV file with email addresses. Ensure correct roles (portal and content) are selected in both methods. Specify content access permissions as needed.

### User Management: Reader Self-Registration FAQs

- **No default reader group selected:** Self-registered readers get unrestricted access to the knowledge base.
- **Multiple group memberships:** Readers receive the highest level of access for each content item.
- **Individual vs. group access:** The highest privilege from both settings is granted to the reader.
- **Access prioritization:** The highest privilege at each content level determines access.
- **Self-registration not working with SSO:** Self-registration requires the Document360 login page, which is bypassed by SSO.

### User Management: Reviewer Role Overview

The **Reviewer** role in Document360 allows users to view articles, add comments, and update workflow statuses without editing content. This role is available across Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans, providing controlled access to the Documentation module for streamlined content review.

### User Management: Managing Reviewer Accounts

Manage reviewer accounts in the "Team accounts & groups" section of settings. Edit/delete existing accounts, convert to/from reader accounts, and purchase reviewer add-ons through the billing section. Conversion to reader involves content access permissions selection and optional mapping to reader groups.

**What is an IPv6 format?**\
Eight groups of hexadecimal digits, colon-separated (e.g., FE38:DCE3:124C:C1A2:BA03:6745:EF1C:683D).

**What is an IPv6 unicast address?**\
Identifies a single interface for direct communication, unlike multicast or anycast.

### Authentication: SSO Process

Single Sign-On (SSO) works through a collaboration between a **Service Provider** (e.g., Document360) and an **Identity Provider (IdP)**. When a user accesses the Service Provider, they are redirected to the IdP to authenticate using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the IdP issues an **Access/ID token**, which the Service Provider validates. This establishes a trust relationship, allowing the user to access SSO-enabled applications without additional sign-ins. Document360 supports multiple IdPs, offering flexibility for users to choose their preferred authentication method.

### Authentication: Identity Providers (IdPs)

An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is an external entity that manages user identities and authenticates users, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) to access multiple services with one login. It stores credentials and handles logins for various applications. Each stored entity is called a **principal**. Examples include **Okta**, **Entra ID**, **Google**, **ADFS**, and **OneLogin**.

Crucially, include the scopes _openid_, _email_, and _profile_ and map claims (_sub_, _email_, _name_) according to Document360's specifications. Review and save your configuration in your IdP.

### Authentication: Configuring Document360 for OpenID SSO

Configure Document360 SSO by providing Identity Provider (IdP) Client ID, Secret, and Authorization URL. Enter details like SSO name, custom login text, and enable/disable auto-assignment of reader groups, IdP initiated logins, and account sign out. Upload certificates/keys where needed. Then, click 'Create' to finalize the configuration.

### Authentication: Adding an Application in Your IdP for OpenID

To create a new OpenID application in your Identity Provider:

1. Log in to the admin console.
2. Navigate to the Applications or Enterprise Applications section.
3. Create a new application, naming it (e.g., "Document360 OpenID SSO") and selecting OpenID Connect as the sign-in method.
4. Save your settings.

### Authentication: Configuring Document360 with ADFS

To configure OpenID SSO in Document360, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Configure the Identity Provider (IdP)** page in Document360.
2. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from ADFS into the corresponding fields.
3. Ensure the **Client Identifier** matches the **Relying Party Identifier** in ADFS.
4. Toggle the **Allow IdP initiated sign in** option based on project needs.
5. Enter the **Issuer URL** from ADFS as the **Authority** in Document360.
6. Proceed to the **More settings** page and configure:

- **SSO Name**: Enter a descriptive name.
- **Customize login button**: Provide user-friendly text.
- **Auto assign reader group**: Enable/disable based on access policies.
- **Sign out idle SSO team account**: Set according to security requirements.
- Choose to invite existing users to SSO.

7. Click **Create** to complete the configuration.

This setup integrates Document360 with ADFS for seamless user authentication.

### 976. Enterprise SSO using \***\*JWT\*\***

**Key Information:** Document360's JWT SSO leverages a customer application for user authentication. User logs in to customer app, which requests an auth code via backchannel from Identity Provider (using client credentials). Document360 receives the auth code and requests an ID token/access token. Document360 creates a session, automatically renewing it within a configurable timeframe (5 to 1440 minutes). No separate Document360 reader account is required (only app account). This approach is exclusive to other SSO methods (SAML, OpenID).

### Authentication: Removing an OpenID SSO Configuration

Delete an SSO configuration in Document360 by accessing the project's Knowledge base, navigating to Settings > Users & security > SAML/OpenID. Hover over the SSO configuration to reveal the Delete icon. Confirm deletion in the popup, understanding it removes associated user accounts.

### Authentication: JWT SSO Configuration

Configure SSO in Document360 by creating a JWT under Settings > Users & security > JWT, then copy the Client ID, Callback URL, and Client secret for your application. Enable/disable JWT SSO login, configure the login URL, and set up redirection using the `redirectUrl` parameter in the URL. Note: Client secret is only available once and must be regenerated if lost.

### Authentication: Setting Up JWT SSO

To set up JWT-based Single Sign-On (SSO) in Document360, follow these steps:

1. **Understand JWT**: A JSON Web Token (JWT) securely transfers authentication and authorization data between applications. It consists of a header, payload, and signature.

2. **Check SSO Plan Compatibility**: Verify if your subscription plan supports SSO. While the table provided is empty, typically higher-tier plans like Enterprise include such features.

3. **Generate JWT Token**: Upon user login, generate a JWT token. Include necessary claims (e.g., user ID, email) and set an expiration time for security.

4. **Configure Secret Key**: Use a strong secret key to sign the JWT. Ensure this key is shared with Document360 for token verification.

5. **Set Up Redirect Flow**: When accessing Document360, users are redirected to your login page. Post-login, generate the JWT and redirect them back with the token.

6. **Test the Flow**: Validate the entire process, ensuring smooth user authentication without additional logins.

7. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to Document360’s API documentation for specific requirements and endpoints.

This setup enhances user convenience and security, streamlining access to Document360.

### User Management: Reader Groups

Document360 reader groups grant precise access to private knowledge base content. Users must log in. Groups can be created to restrict access to specific categories (e.g., sales team only sees pricing/billing). Members are then assigned to those groups.

To resolve the 401 Unauthorized error during JWT testing in Postman, follow these organized steps:

1. **Authorize the Request**:

- In Postman, navigate to the Authorization tab of your request.
- Set the authorization type to **Basic Auth**.
- Enter your **Client ID** as the Username and **Client Secret** as the Password.

2. **Verify Request Format**:

- Switch to the Body tab.
- Select **raw** and ensure the format is set to **JSON**.
- Include all required parameters, such as **grant_type**, in your JSON payload.

3. **Confirm Credentials**:

- Double-check that the Client ID and Secret are correct and properly entered.

4. **Check Endpoint URL**:

- Ensure you're using the correct token endpoint URL as specified in the documentation.

5. **Inspect Server Response**:

- If an error occurs, examine the response body for additional details that can indicate the issue, such as "invalid grant type" or "bad credentials."

6. **Review System Configuration**:

- Verify with your system administrator that the Client ID and Secret are correctly registered on the server side.

By systematically addressing each of these areas, you can identify and resolve the cause of the 401 error.

### Authentication: JWT Reader Groups

JWT reader accounts can be linked to existing Document360 reader groups, inheriting their restriction settings to control knowledge base access. These groups function like regular reader groups, with support for single sign-on (SSO) across Free, Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans.

### User Management: Finding Reader Group IDs

For JWT SSO-enabled projects, Reader group IDs can be found in **Settings > Users and Security > Readers & groups**. Each reader group displays a **Group Id** below its name, with a copy icon for easy pasting into the payload. Note: Available only for JWT-configured projects, not regular private knowledge bases.

### Authentication: Using JWT Reader Groups

Configure JWT reader access by providing a user's details (name, email) and a list of reader group IDs in a specific JSON format. Changes to reader groups only apply after the current JWT session expires (token validity). Use comma-separated IDs in the `readerGroupIds` array. Min token validity is 5 minutes, max is 1 day.

### Site Customization: Customizing Search Highlight Color

To customize highlighted search results in knowledge base articles, navigate to Knowledge Base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript. Modify the provided CSS snippet (different for KB Site 1.0 and KB Site 2.0) changing the `background-color` and `color` properties. Save the changes. This allows altering the highlight color from the default yellow, to any desired color.

### Site Customization: Hiding the Workspace Dropdown

To hide the project workspace dropdown in the knowledge base site, add the CSS `header .header_bottom .header_bottom_nav ul li.versions-selection { display: none; }` to the site's custom CSS. This removes the dropdown, requiring users to navigate to workspaces using direct URLs.

### Site Customization: Customizing Hyperlink Color in Dark Mode

Access the Custom CSS section in your Knowledge Base settings, add a CSS snippet targeting hyperlinks in Dark mode, and customize the color to your preference. Save changes to apply the new hyperlink color in Dark mode.

### Site Customization: Enlarging PDF Previews

To enlarge the PDF preview, access your Knowledge Base site settings, navigate to the Custom CSS section, and apply the CSS snippet to adjust the PDF container width. This ensures the preview expands to full width, improving visibility across different browsers.

### Content Formatting: Adding Scrollbars to Code Blocks

Add vertical scrollbars to code blocks by either:

1. Wrapping specific code blocks in `<div class="scroll">` and adding custom CSS to set height and enable scrolling.
2. Applying global CSS to all code blocks using `.code-toolbar` selectors.

Outcome: Scrollbars appear for code blocks exceeding the specified height, keeping content within a fixed area.

### Content Formatting: Aligning Table Content

To vertically align table content to the top in your knowledge base, add this CSS code to custom CSS settings: `table td, table th, table tr { vertical-align: top !important; }`. This overrides the default alignment. Follow the Knowledge base customization steps to save the changes.

### Site Customization: Customizing Table Borders

To make table borders bold, navigate to Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript. Add the CSS snippet:

```css
table td,
table th,
table tr {
  border: 3px solid #000000 !important;
}
```

Adjust the `3px` thickness and `#000000` color as needed, then save. This will apply the changes to all tables in the knowledge base.

### Site Customization: Restricting Content Copying

Prevent content copying by intercepting the "cut," "copy," and "paste" events using JavaScript on specific HTML elements (`content_block`, `d360-article-content`). This solution uses custom CSS and JavaScript, is adjustable to different content areas, and has minimal disruption on user experience. User selection of content is allowed but prevents copying with Ctrl+C or alternative actions. This is a mitigation strategy, not a foolproof solution.

### Content Enhancement: Setting Default PDF Dimensions

To set custom dimensions for embedded PDFs, navigate to the CSS settings in your knowledge base site and add the provided CSS snippet with your desired height and width in pixels.

### Content Formatting: Centering Headings in Markdown

To center-align headings in Markdown, use HTML `<hN style="text-align:center;">` tags. Markdown lacks built-in centering. Document360 provides a WYSIWYG editor and markdown editor for content creation and formatting. It's a platform for knowledge base management and content creation.

### Content Formatting: Centering Text in Markdown

To center-align text in Markdown, use the HTML `<p>` tag with `style="text-align:center;"`. Replace "Text_content" with your desired text. Example: `<p style="text-align:center;">Sample text</p>`. You can also apply basic formatting inside the paragraph.

### Content Formatting: Changing Text Color in Markdown

Use an HTML `<span style="color:desiredColor;">` tag to change text color. Markdown doesn't directly support inline styles, so HTML is needed. Replace `desiredColor` and the text within the span tags with your desired values.

### Site Customization: Customizing Code Block Language Names

To change the language name in code blocks to a custom name (e.g., "Example") across your entire knowledge base, modify the site's Custom CSS, specifically targeting the code block toolbar. Hide the default language name, and display a new "Example" label. This is a global change.

To set dark mode as the default for your Knowledge Base site, you can use custom JavaScript. Here's how:

1. **Access Customization Settings**: Go to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript**.

2. **Add JavaScript**: Paste this snippet into the JavaScript tab to trigger dark mode on page load:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
  setTimeout(function () {
    document.getElementById('darkTheme').click();
  }, 100);
});
```

Then save your changes.

3. **Disable Theme Switching (Optional)**: To enforce dark mode, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site**, select **Dark only** under **Site theme**, and save.

This ensures dark mode is the default, with the option to prevent users from switching to light mode. The script reliably triggers dark mode if the 'darkTheme' element is present, and testing post-implementation is recommended to ensure compatibility.

### Site Customization: Centering Headings

To center-align headings (H2, H3, H4) in Document360 articles, navigate to Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript, paste the CSS snippet `H2, H3, H4 { text-align: center; }`, and save. This globally centers all specified headings.

### Site Customization: Changing Table Header Color

To change table header color in a knowledge base site, navigate to customization settings, add custom CSS targeting either `table th` (KB site 1.0) or `.editor360-table th` (KB site 2.0). Change the background color in the CSS to meet your requirements and save. This modifies the header color across all tables on the site.

### Site Customization: Changing Callout Colors in Dark Mode

To change the callout colors in dark mode, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript**, then add the provided CSS snippet. Modify the `background-color`, `color`, and `border-left` properties for `.infoBox`, `.errorBox`, and `.warningBox` classes to update the callout colors in dark mode. Remember to use `!important` to override default styles.

### Content Formatting: Adding Extra Space in Markdown

To add space in Markdown, use HTML tags: `<br>` for vertical space between lines, and `&nbsp;` for horizontal space between words within a line. Markdown doesn't natively support extra spacing.

### Content Formatting: Aligning Images in Markdown

Images are left-aligned by default in Markdown. Markdown lacks built-in image alignment. The document suggests a workaround, but the details are missing.

### Content Formatting: Adding Accordions in Markdown

To add an accordion in Markdown, use HTML's `<details>` and `<summary>` tags. Wrap your content within `<details>`, use `<summary>` for the title, and place content inside `<p>`. You can include headings by using `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.

**Code Example**:

```html
<details>
  <summary><strong>Accordion Title</strong></summary>
  <p>Content here...</p>
</details>
```

**Caution**: Adding headings in the summary may affect text alignment. You can nest lists, headings, and other HTML within the content section.

### Site Customization: Advanced Accordion Customization

Enhance accordions with colors, dotted borders, and icons using CSS. Add header colors via CSS, create hover effects with border transitions, and set accordions to always open with the `open` HTML attribute. Use CSS to add rotating plus icons. While Markdown can create basic accordions, advanced styling requires CSS/HTML.

### Site Customization: Adding Background Images to Text

To add a background image to text in a knowledge base site, use custom CSS (via Custom CSS & JavaScript settings). Apply a CSS class to the text element, specifying the background image URL. Then, apply that class to your desired text in HTML. This approach works in the site's editor, either through code view or directly applying the styled element. Web-accessible images are required.

### Site Customization: Sorting Table Content

To sort tables on a knowledge base site, add custom CSS (to style headers and display sort indicators) and JavaScript (to handle the sorting logic). The CSS styles headers for clickability and displays ascending/descending icons. JavaScript code sorts table rows based on selected column content, maintains current sort state (ascending or descending), and updates the sort indicator in the header. Users click on headers to initiate sorting.

1. Use the HTML `<p>` tag with inline styling to align images. For center alignment, use:

```html
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="[Image-URL]" /></p>
```

2. Replace `[Image-URL]` with the image URL from Document360 Drive. To find the URL:

- Navigate to the image in Drive.
- Click "View details" and copy the URL from the file details.

3. Adjust alignment by changing the `text-align` value to `left` or `right`.

4. This method works for any image file type, including buttons and logos.

### Site Customization: Opening Links in New Tabs

To open all links in knowledge base articles in new tabs, customize the site's CSS & JavaScript. Insert provided JavaScript code targeting specific HTML elements containing links (`content_block_text a` or `block-article a`) setting the `target` attribute to `_blank`. Save the changes. This will force all links within those elements to open in new tabs.

### Site Customization: Changing Table of Contents Color

To change the table of contents color, use custom CSS. For **KB Site 1.0**, target `.content_block .content_container .page-action .article_action_links ul li a` and set the color. For **KB Site 2.0**, use `d360-table-of-content .toc-item .toc-toggle-icon, d360-table-of-content .toc-item a` for all items and `d360-table-of-content .toc-item.selected a` for selected headings. Replace color values as needed and save changes.

### Content Enhancement: Setting Default Featured Images

In Document360, set a default featured image for knowledge base articles to ensure consistent thumbnails on social media shares. This replaces a random article image if no specific featured image is defined for an article. The default image must be publicly accessible.

### Site Customization: Customizing Hyperlink Size

To customize hyperlink size, use custom CSS available in the Enterprise plan:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge Base Site** > **Customize Site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.

2. Add CSS:

```css
.CustomLink {
  font-size: 25px;
}
```

3. Apply the class to hyperlinks:

```html
<a class="CustomLink" href="your-link">Link Text</a>
```

4. Adjust the font-size value and save changes.

### Content Formatting: Adding Image Borders in Markdown

Use HTML within Markdown. Add a `style="border: [width]px [style] [color];"` attribute to the `<img>` tag. Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="description" style="border: 2px solid grey;">` Adjust width, style, and color as needed. Alternative, consult linked article for shadows.

### Content Enhancement: Embedding YouTube Shorts

To embed a YouTube Short, use an iframe. Replace `/shorts/` with `/embed/` in the Short's URL. Use the provided iframe code, adjusting the `src` attribute with the embed URL. The optimal size is 315px x 560px, but you can vary it as needed.

### Content Formatting: Adding Image Shadows in Markdown

Use HTML within Markdown to add shadows with `box-shadow` CSS. Example:

```html
<img
  src="image.jpg"
  alt="Image description"
  style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px gray;"
/>
```

Customize horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color to your preference.

1. Navigate to Knowledge base portal Settings () > Knowledge base site > Integrations.
2. Under Custom HTML, click Add.
3. Paste the meta tags with your image URL:

```
<meta property="og:image" content="Image_URL" />
<meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="Image_URL" />
```

4. Replace "Image_URL" with your image link (e.g., from Document360 drive) and click Add.

This sets a default image for social media shares when articles don't have a featured image.

Before/after screenshots demonstrate the change.

### Site Customization: Changing Feedback Button Colors

To change the color of feedback buttons, follow these steps:

1. **Access Custom CSS/JS**: Ensure you're on an Enterprise plan, as this feature is only available there.
2. **Target Feedback Buttons**: Use CSS to select the feedback buttons using their class or ID.
3. **Apply Color**: Define a new color using a hex or RGB value within your CSS rules.
4. **Save and Test**: Implement the changes and test the appearance of the buttons.

Example CSS:

```css
.feedback-button {
  background-color: #ff6b6b; /* Replace with desired color code */
}
```

### Site Customization: Hiding the Footer on Mobile

Hide custom footers on mobile for better user experience. Mobile-optimized layouts prioritize content above the footer on smaller screens.

### Content Enhancement: Embedding Loom Videos

To embed a Loom video into your Document360 page:

1. Access your desired video in Loom.
2. Click **Share** > **Embed**, select the fixed size, and copy the embed code.
3. Paste the code into the editor you're using:

- **Markdown editor**: Paste directly.

The video will then be embedded in your article.

### Site Customization: Changing Header Hover Color

To change the hover color of knowledge base header menu options, add specific CSS targeting those elements, in the Knowledge Base site's custom CSS settings. The example provided uses red, but you can adjust as needed. The documentation shows both the initial state and the state after the CSS changes are applied.

### Site Customization: Changing Header Hover Color

To customize the hover color of header options, users with Business or Enterprise plans can use custom CSS. Apply a CSS rule targeting the header elements' hover state. For example:

```css
.header-link:hover {
  color: #yourdesiredcolor;
}
```

### Site Customization: Repositioning Related Articles

To move the related articles above the feedback section, follow the unspecified steps and likely utilize custom CSS or Javascript to change the default placement.

### Site Customization: Hiding Footer in Mobile View

To hide the footer on mobile devices for a Knowledge Base site, follow these concise steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.
2. Choose the correct CSS snippet based on your site version:

- **KB site 1.0**: Use CSS targeting `.custom-footer` with `max-width: 469px`.
- **KB site 2.0**: Use CSS targeting `site-footer-section` with `max-width: 767px`.

3. Paste the selected CSS snippet into the CSS tab and click **Save**.
4. **Test the site** to ensure the footer is hidden on mobile without affecting other elements.

### Site Customization: Hiding the Change Password Option

To remove the "Change Password" option for knowledge base readers, customize the site's CSS by hiding related HTML elements. This edits `.user-dropdown-content .user-detail .portal-link a` and `.nav-bar-profile button.dropdown-item` selectors to hide the link in the user dropdown; save the change.

### Site Customization: Hiding the Category Manager

Project-specific solution (impacting all workspaces) uses custom CSS/JS to restrict article access to specific URLs. Readers can only view articles with matching URLs . This hides the category manager.

The solution involves adding a JavaScript snippet to your Document360 Knowledge Base 1.0 site to move the related articles section above the feedback section. Here's a concise overview of the steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.
2. Under the JavaScript tab, paste the provided snippet:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  $('.content_block_text').append('<div class="sperator"><hr></div>');
  $('.related-articles-container').appendTo('.content_block_text');
};
```

3. Save the changes to implement the modification.

This script appends a separator line to the content block and moves the related articles above the feedback section.

1. Access **Settings**, navigate to **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.
2. In the JavaScript section, paste the following code:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  $('.content_block_text').append('<div class="sperator"><hr></div>');
  $('.related-articles-container').appendTo('.content_block_text');
};
```

3. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

To hide the change password option for readers using custom CSS or JS on Business or Enterprise plans:

1. **Identify the Element**: Locate the HTML element (e.g., button or link) for the change password option. Use browser developer tools to find its class or ID.

2. **CSS Implementation**: Write CSS to hide the element. For example:

```css
.change-password-link {
  display: none;
}
```

3. **JavaScript Enhancement**: If the element is dynamically loaded, use a Mutation Observer to detect and hide it when it appears. Alternatively, remove it directly after DOM loads:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  document.querySelector('.change-password-link').remove();
});
```

4. **Consider Dynamic Content**: If the site uses AJAX, ensure your script runs after content loads or use a mutation observer for real-time changes.

5. **Test Across Scenarios**: Verify functionality across browsers, devices, and page scenarios, ensuring no accessibility issues arise.

6. **Security Note**: Hiding the UI doesn't prevent direct URL access. Consider backend restrictions for full security.

By following these steps, you can effectively hide the change password option while maintaining site functionality.

### Billing: Downgrade FAQs

Downgrading preserves data but may limit features and storage. Billing adjusts with a potential credit. Features tied to the higher plan might be lost, but data remains. Upgrade is possible later, but limits from the lower plan apply until upgraded again. Review new plan details before downgrading and consult support if needed.

### Troubleshooting: Understanding HAR Files

A HAR (HTTP Archive) file is a JSON log of a web browser's interaction with a webpage, capturing requests, responses, timings, cookies, and other metadata for debugging and performance analysis. Web browsers and tools can generate them. Used by Document360 team.

### Troubleshooting: Generating HAR Files

To troubleshoot Document360 issues, generate a HAR file capturing network activity in your web browser's developer tools. Open dev tools, enable network recording, reproduce the problem, stop recording, and save the generated HAR file. Follow browser-specific UI variations. Instructions are similar across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera. Targeted at Document360 users.

To generate a HAR file, follow these steps in your browser:

1. **Chrome**:

- Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect).
- Navigate to the Network tab.
- Begin recording (Ctrl+E or the record button).
- Refresh the page or perform the desired actions.
- Once done, right-click on the request list and choose "Save All As HAR" to export.

2. **Firefox**:

- Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect).
- Go to the Network tab.
- Start recording (toggle the record button).
- Carry out the necessary actions.
- Right-click anywhere in the Network tab > Select "Save All As HAR" to save.

**Tips**:

- Clear your browser cache before recording to capture accurate data.
- Be cautious as HAR files contain sensitive data; ensure personal information is removed before sharing.

This method effectively captures network traffic for troubleshooting using built-in browser tools.
