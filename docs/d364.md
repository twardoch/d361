### Compliance: GDPR

Full GDPR compliance. Collects/stores only essential data with explicit consent. [Learn more](https://document360.com/gdpr-compliance/).

### Security: X-Frame Options

Controls embedding in frames/iframes on other domains. Prevents malicious sites from embedding knowledge base content. Blocks unauthorized iframe embedding.

### Support and Help

Expert support for security and infrastructure. API defined as software communication protocol. X-Frame-Options security feature explained.

### Security: Content Security Policy (CSP)

Restricts external CSS, scripts, and frames to prevent malicious content. The `Content-Security-Policy` header controls allowed domains by resource type. Implementation varies by plan tier.

### Security: Enabling CSP

Enable CSP to prevent XSS attacks:
1. Specify allowed domains for stylesheets, JavaScript, frames in portal security settings
2. Use correct URL format (`https://example.com`)
3. Separate entries with commas
4. Add nonce attributes to custom HTML scripts

### Security: Configuring X-Frame Options

Enable X-Frame options to prevent embedding on external domains:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Users & Security > Security**
2. Toggle **Enable X-Frame options** on

Protection against clickjacking attacks. Specific domains can be allowed via CSP. Unauthorized embedding exposes users to security threats.

### Security: Testing CSP Settings

CSP implemented via meta elements, not response headers. Verify by checking page source for `Content-Security-Policy`. Video playback issues often indicate inconsistent CSP settings across articles.

### Security: Understanding Bot Management

Bot filtering for online safety:
- Identifies and blocks malicious bots
- Allows legitimate bot access
- Prevents server strain and threats

Focus on blocking bad bots while enabling good bots.

### Security: CSP and Whitelisting for Widgets

Widget CSP guidelines (Enterprise plans only):

**Directives**:
- `connect-src`: Algolia, Document360 APIs, Azure Monitor
- `script-src-elem`: CDN resources with nonce
- `font-src`: Google Fonts, Document360 CDN
- `style-src-elem`: Inline styles, CDN resources, Google Fonts

**Sources**:
- US and EU-specific Document360 domains
- Widget JavaScript requires correct nonce and API key

### Security: Bot Detection Methods

Cloudflare uses heuristics and machine learning to analyze traffic and user-agent data, identifying and blocking malicious bots.

### Security: Bot Blocking Techniques

Cloudflare blocks bots through:
- Unusual user agents
- Unsupported ports
- Suspicious IP/ISP patterns

Essential security measures protecting platforms.

### Security: Bot Categorization

**Good Bots**: GoogleBot, BingBot, GPTBot (transparent, beneficial)
**Bad Bots**: DDoS attacks, web scraping, credential stuffing (malicious)

Built-in bot detection and blocking in Block mode protects data integrity.

### Fair Usage Policy: Overview

Rate limiting controls request volume, preventing bot traffic and DoS attacks while maintaining positive user experience.

### Fair Usage Policy: Rate Limiting

Cloudflare enforces:
- 1,500 requests per minute per IP
- 300 requests per 10 seconds per IP
- Bot detection via heuristics and machine learning

### Fair Usage Policy: Compliance

Policy adherence prevents:
- System overload
- Server strain
- Service abuse
- Unintended high-volume requests

Contact support for higher limits if needed.
