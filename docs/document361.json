Categories & Articles (Category manager)\n\nWriting and publishing articles in Document360 is simple: pick your category, create an article(title and slug), add SEO details, and publish to your knowledge base.\n\nWhen you update or edit an article (Fork), Document360 will create a new Article revision without affecting the live/public workspace.\n\n![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles.png)\n\nYou can make the necessary changes and republish when you're ready.

This feature allows you to create high-quality API documentation that helps users understand and consume your APIs effectively.\n\n![13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation.png)\n\nThis API module includes the **Try it!** feature, which allows the users to test the API endpoints within the Knowledge base site. You can create dedicated versions of your API documentation. The feature provides an intuitive interface for uploading API references as URLs or JSON/YAML files. After uploading the OpenAPI definition, the interactive API endpoint articles are created in the Knowledge base portal. Now, end users can access the **Try it!** option with the available endpoints, parameters, and responses in the API documentation on the Knowledge base site.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Analytics\n\nDocument360 includes an **Analytics** menu with tools to help you understand end-user engagement with your knowledge base.\n\n![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Analytics](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/14_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_analytics.png)\n\nHere is the list of metrics and modules you can track with the Analytics tool:\n\n* **Articles**\n* **Eddy AI**\n* **Search**\n* **Team accounts**\n* **Feedback**\n* **Links status**\n* **Page not found**\n* **Ticket deflector**\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Drive\n\nCentralized and cloud-based storage for Document360 projects that stores and let team members manage all the Knowledge base artifacts (files). If you have already used any other heavyweights, such as Google Drive or OneDrive, getting accustomed to the functions in Document360 Drive should be relatively easy. You can access your Drive by clicking the Drive icon on the left menu.\n\n![7_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Drive](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/16_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_drive.png)\n\n---\n\n### 7.

Type in the keyword and narrow the results using filters such as workspace, language, visibility, tags, and date range. You can preview the article/category page, and then preview the article or navigate to the article in the Editor.\n\n![11_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Search_results](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/19_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_search_bar_dropdown.png)\n\nAs the search is performed universally in the project, it covers files. Users can switch between the article and Drive search using the tabs below the search bar.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Open site\n\nThe Open site () action is used to navigate to and view the Knowledge base site. Clicking the icon will take you to the Knowledge base site of the workspace that is currently open in your knowledge base portal. If you are in the API documentation workspace, the Open site action will take you to the API documentation home page. If your API documentation site does not have a home page, you will be directed to the first article or category page in the API documentation.\n\n---",

Password-cracking tools often come with dictionary lists that will try thousands of familiar names and words.\n\n  + If you must use dictionary words, try adding numbers and special characters to them, such as \"In$t@llat10n.\"\n* Don’t use simple adjacent keyboard combinations like \"qwerty,\" \"asdzxc,\" \"abcdef,\" or \"123456.\" These are generic and easy to crack.\n\n---",

The content within an iframe is a separate web page displayed within a specific section of another web page. Due to its ability to embed external content, managing iframe usage with security settings such as X-Frame options is crucial to prevent security risks like clickjacking.\n\n#### What are the embedded tags that I can restrict with the X-Frame options?\n\nThe X-Frame options setting allows you to control whether your knowledge base can be embedded in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>` tags on external domains.\n\n#### Why are X-Frame options important?\n\nThe X-Frame options are vital for security as they help prevent clickjacking attacks, where an attacker embeds your knowledge base in a malicious website. This embedding tricks users into performing unintended actions. Enabling X-Frame options ensures your knowledge base cannot be embedded on external domains, safeguarding user interactions.\n\n#### How can I configure the X-Frame options for my knowledge base?\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users & security** > **Security**\n2. Locate the toggle labeled **Enable X-Frame options** and switch it on to prevent your knowledge base from being embedded on unauthorized external domains.\n\n#### Can I allow specific domains to embed my Knowledge Base?\n\nYes, you can specify the allowed domains in the Frame source of content security policy setting. For more information, see the [content security policy](/docs/content-security-policy) article.\n\n#### How can I test if my X-Frame options are working?\n\nYou can test if your X-Frame options are correctly configured by:\n\n1. Using your browser’s developer tools and checking the **Network** tab to inspect response headers for the **X-Frame-Options** setting.\n2. Using third-party services like [securityheaders.com](http://securityheaders.com) to verify that the correct X-Frame-Options header is applied.\n\n#### What are the potential risks of not using X-Frame options?\n\nIf the X-Frame options are not enabled for your knowledge base, it may be embedded in an iframe on another website without your authorization. This lack of control exposes your site to clickjacking attacks, where attackers overlay invisible or misleading elements over your interface to trick users into performing unintended actions, such as divulging passwords or clicking on malicious links. Such vulnerabilities can compromise user security and potentially lead to data breaches.\n\n#### What is clickjacking?\n\nClickjacking, also known as UI redressing or UI masking, is a malicious technique where attackers trick users into clicking on a button or link that is hidden or obscured within a web page or application. This is often achieved by overlaying a transparent layer with deceptive elements over a legitimate website or application. Users may think they are interacting with the actual site, but in reality, they are engaging with elements controlled by the attacker. Such interactions can lead to adverse outcomes, like downloading malware, making unauthorized purchases, or inadvertently sharing sensitive information. Utilizing security settings like X-Frame options can help protect against such attacks by preventing unauthorized embedding of your content.\n\n#### What is a malicious website?\n\nA malicious website is a site designed to cause harm to visitors or their devices. These sites may trick visitors into downloading malware, stealing personal information, or engaging in fraudulent activities. Using X-Frame options helps prevent your content from being embedded on such sites, enhancing your security measures against these risks.\n\nAn online library where users can find information about a product, service, department, or topic.

Once forked, you can modify the conditions as needed.\n\n**If an article is translated into multiple languages, does conditional content apply to all languages?**\n\nYes, the conditions set on a content block will apply across all translated versions of the article. However, if different visibility rules are needed for different languages, you will need to apply conditions specifically for each translation.\n\n**What happens if no conditions are met?**\n\nIf no conditions are met, the content block will behave according to the default visibility rules. By default, the block will be visible to all users unless explicitly set to **Hide** for all conditions.\n\n**If I change the project type from Private to Public, what happens to the conditions?**\n\nIf your project type changes from **Private to Public**, any conditions using parameters like **IP address** or **Reader groups** (which are only applicable in private/mixed projects) will be automatically disabled, and those parameters will no longer be available for selection.\n\n**What happens to conditional content if I clone a article?**\n\nIf you clone a article that contains conditional content blocks, all the conditions will be copied over as they are. You can then edit the conditions in the duplicated article if needed.\n\n**Can I apply multiple \"Or\" conditions?**\n\nYes, you can apply multiple **OR** conditions. For example, if you want to show content to users in either **India** or **USA**, you can set the condition **Country equals India OR Country equals USA**. The content will be visible to users from either country.\n\n**Can conditions be time-bound?**\n\nYes, conditions can be time-bound by using the **Date** parameter. For example, if you want content to be visible only between specific dates, you can set the condition **Date between Dec 1, 2024, and Dec 10, 2024**. The content will automatically stop being visible after Dec 10, 2024.\n\n**What happens if I delete a reader group that is part of a condition?**\n\nIf a reader group that is part of a conditional content block is deleted, the condition associated with that group will no longer be applied.\n\n**Can I apply conditions based on the user's session (e.g., logged-in vs. logged-out users)?**\n\nAt this time, conditional content does not apply directly to user session status (logged-in or logged-out).\n\n**If I move an article with conditional content between workspaces, do the conditions still apply?**\n\nYes, the conditional content blocks and their conditions will move along with the article when it is transferred between workspaces. However, you should verify that the conditions are still relevant in the new workspace.\n\n**How do conditions affect articles that have multiple versions (e.g., published and draft versions)?**\n\nConditional content settings are version-specific. If you fork an article to create a new version, the conditions set in the original version will carry over to the new version. You can then edit the conditions in the new version as needed.\n\n**Is there a limit to the number of conditions I can apply to a single block?**\n\nYes, you can apply up to 25 conditions per article. However, for performance and clarity, it is recommended to limit the number of complex conditions to ensure that content loads efficiently and is easy to manage.\n\n<a id=\"tables-in-advanced-wysiwyg-editor\"></a>",

You create a category called **Shipping Information** with subcategories like **Domestic shipping**, **International shipping**, **Shipping rates**, and **Delivery times**. This structure enables customers to easily find the exact information they need, reducing frustration and improving their overall experience.\n\n![Document360 interface showing categories, articles, and their publication statuses for user guidance.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Catagory_n_subcategory_in_portal.png)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What are categories and subcategories in documentation?\n\nCategories and subcategories are organizational structures in a knowledge base used to group related articles by topic. This makes it easier for users to navigate and find relevant information.\n\n#### How do categories and subcategories differ?\n\nCategories represent broad topics, while subcategories provide more specific divisions within those topics. Articles are hierarchically organized under subcategories, which are grouped under their respective parent categories.\n\n#### Why do I need subcategories?\n\nSubcategories help segment information into smaller, focused groups, enhancing understanding, accessibility, and navigation.\n\n**Example:** If \"Cars\" is the main category, subcategories like \"Sedan,\" \"SUV,\" and \"Convertible\" allow users to quickly locate content specific to their interests.\n\n#### Can I customize the categories and subcategories?\n\nYes, Document360 allows team accounts to create, edit, and delete categories and subcategories based on organizational needs. Customization options include changing icons for better visual appeal.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> For more information, read the article on Managing categories.\n\n#### How can categories and subcategories improve knowledge base usability?\n\nLogical groupings simplify browsing, enabling readers to find relevant information without sifting through unrelated content.\n\n#### Can a single article belong to multiple categories or subcategories?\n\nYes, you can display an article in multiple categories or subcategories using the **Replicate** () option in Document360.\n\n#### What is the best practice for naming categories and subcategories?\n\nUse clear and descriptive names that reflect the content contained within each category or subcategory. Avoid jargon and aim for user-friendly naming conventions.\n\n#### How should I organize my categories and subcategories for optimal user experience?\n\nStructure categories and subcategories based on logical relationships and user needs. A tree-like format broad categories divided into specific subcategories works best.\n\n**Example:** In the Document360 Knowledge base, categories and subcategories align with the sequential flow of features and menus in the portal.\n\n#### Can I apply different access permissions to certain categories or subcategories?\n\nYes, Document360 supports role-based content access control, allowing restrictions on specific categories or subcategories. If no explicit restrictions are set, permissions inherit from parent categories.\n\n#### Is it possible to reorder categories and subcategories after they are created?\n\nYes, Document360 lets you reorder categories and subcategories using the drag-and-drop () icon.\n\n#### Why is the category/subcategory not visible on my Knowledge base site? How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA category or subcategory might not appear on the site in the following scenarios:\n\n* All articles within it are hidden or not published.\n* The category/subcategory is empty, with no articles added.\n\nTry the below steps if the category tree fails to load on the Knowledge base site:\n\n* Check if JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.\n* Clear your browser cache and cookies to resolve potential caching issues.\n* Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version.\n* Test the category tree on a different browser or device to verify if the issue is browser-specific.\n\nOrganizes related articles under a common theme in the knowledge base.\n\nA secondary category in Document360 used to organize and display groups of related articles.

    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\n### **Article limit reached**\n\n**Error:** `documentation.categoriesAndArticles.maxArticlesCountReached` and `documentation.categoriesAndArticles.articleLimitExceedsPerCategory`\n\nThese errors occurs when the article limit for a **category** or **project** has been exceeded. It commonly happens in the following scenarios:\n\n* Creating a **large number of articles** within a category or project that exceeds the allowed limit.\n* **Bulk importing** a significant number of articles into a category.\n* Adding a **page type subcategory** within another category.\n\n**Steps to resolve**\n\n1. Check if the error occurs across **all categories** in your workspace.\n2. In Document360, the maximum number of articles per category and per project depends on your plan:\n\n   **Category limits**\n\n   * Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans: Up to **100 articles per category**.\n\n   **Project Limits**\n\n   * Professional & Business plans: Up to **5,000 articles per workspace**.\n   * Enterprise plan: Up to **10,000 articles per workspace**.\n3. If your workspace has exceeded these limits, reduce the number of articles in a category or upgrade your plan if needed.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n![Overview of document categories and articles with highlighted error message that indicates the article creation limit is reached.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1739518144665.png)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What is the character limit for article titles?\n\nThe character limit for article titles is 150 characters, including spaces. Special characters like $, %, \\*, {, }, \", <, and > are not allowed.\n\n#### What are the best practices for creating an article title and URL slug?\n\nWhen creating an article title, remember that the URL slug is derived from the title. Document360 automatically separates words with hyphens and removes special characters/punctuation in the slug. Further updates to the URL slug can be made later.\n\n#### How can I identify the published status of an article?\n\nThe published status of an article is indicated by a colored dot next to the article name:\n\n* Light blue dot: A new article which is not yet published.\n* Light green dot: The article is published.\n\n#### Do I need to save my content frequently?\n\nNo, Document360 automatically saves your content every 5 seconds. You can also save manually using **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac).\n\n#### What should I do if I cannot access an article or see recent updates?\n\nIf you’re having trouble accessing an article or viewing recent updates, try the following steps:\n\n* Refresh the page.\n* Ensure the article title or link is correct.\n* Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again.\n* If the article was recently published or updated, allow a few moments for the changes to reflect.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n#### What happens after I create a new article from a template?\n\nYour article will be added to the respective category/subcategory with a New article status indicator (light-blue dot).\n\n#### What happens after an article is published?\n\nAfter an article is published, it will appear in your Knowledge base site for readers, and its status will be updated from Draft to Published in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n#### How can I edit a published article?\n\nTo edit a published article, click the **Edit** button at the top-right of the editor. This will change the article status back to Draft, allowing you to make changes.\n\n#### What happens when I publish an edited article?\n\nWhen you publish an edited article, the edited version replaces the previously published version in your Knowledge base.\n\n#### Is the 'Edit article' option available for all readers in the Knowledge base site?\n\nNo, the 'Edit article' option is only available for logged-in team accounts on the Knowledge base site.\n\n#### What happens when an article is locked because a user is editing it, and how can it be released?\n\nIn Document360, when a user begins editing an article, the article is locked, preventing others from making changes. This lock is automatically released 15 minutes after the user stops editing, at which point the article becomes available for other users to edit.\n\nIf you need to unlock it before that time, the user editing the article can manually click **Unlock** () icon at the top of the article, near the preview.\n\n#### Can I move articles from one project to another?\n\nThe inbuilt move functionality to move articles from one project to another is currently unavailable.  As a workaround, when transferring multiple articles, use the export feature to save the articles along with all media files from the original project, then import them into the new project. Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste content from articles in one project to another. As a best practice, upload images from the original article to the drive of the new project and then insert them into the new article.\n\n#### What happens to the links and references within an article when it is moved to a new category or workspace?\n\nWhen you move an article to a new category or workspace, all internal links and references within the article will be updated automatically to reflect the new location. This ensures that all links and references remain functional.\n\n#### Are there any security restrictions when moving articles across workspaces?\n\nYes, security restrictions will apply based on the destination workspace and category. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to move articles to the target workspace and category.\n\n#### What is a hidden article?\n\nA hidden article will not be listed in the Knowledge base site and cannot be accessed through the direct link, but will appear in the Knowledge base portal for internal use.\n\n#### How can I hide a single article?\n\nTo hide a single article, navigate to  **Documentation** () in the Knowledge base portal, hover over the desired article, click on the **More** () icon, and select **Hide**.\n\n#### Can I hide multiple articles at once?\n\nYes, you can hide multiple articles at once by navigating to the **All articles** () section in **Documentation** (), selecting the desired articles, and clicking the **Hide** option at the top of the pane.\n\n#### Will hidden articles appear in search results?\n\nNo, hidden articles are excluded from search results.\n\n#### How can I hide an article from the Knowledge base site while still allowing access via its URL?\n\nTo hide an article while maintaining access through its URL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to Settings () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site**.\n2. Click on **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.\n3. Paste the following code in the JavaScript tab:\n\n```\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('a[href=\"SLUG NAME\"]').parent().css({\"display\": \"none\"});\n    $('a[href=\"SLUG NAME\"]').parent().css({\"display\": \"none\"});\n});\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n4. Click **Save**.\n\n#### How do I restore my deleted articles?\n\nYou can restore your deleted articles from the **Recycle bin**. The deleted articles will remain in the Recycle bin for 30 days. For more information, read the article on [Recycle bin](/help/docs/recycle-bin-recent-and-starred-files).\n\n#### Why doesn't the article name change reflect on the Knowledge base site?\n\n* If the article is in **Draft** status, the change in the article name doesn't reflect immediately on the site. The article name change will only be reflected after publishing it.\n* If the article is in **Published** status, the change in the article name will reflect immediately on the Knowledge base site.\n\n#### Can I clone and replicate articles across different workspaces?\n\nYou can clone articles within or across workspaces. However, replication is limited to the same workspace.\n\n#### What happens if I delete the source article of a replicated article?\n\nIf the source article is deleted, the replicated articles will also be removed from their respective categories.\n\n#### Is there a limit to the number of times an article can be replicated or cloned?\n\nDocument360 does not limit the number of times you can replicate or clone articles, allowing flexibility in content management.\n\n#### Why am I getting 404 errors when trying to access articles other than the homepage or the first article? How do I resolve it?\n\nThis issue typically occurs due to incorrect slug configuration or folder name changes in the subfolder hosting page. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Verify article slugs: Ensure the slugs for your articles are correctly configured. For example, the first article might load using the slug /docs, but other articles may require a different slug, such as /help. In such cases, make sure all the slugs are consistent.\n2. Check subfolder settings: Navigate to the subfolder hosting page and confirm if the `/docs` folder has been renamed or altered. If it has been renamed, update it back to `docs` to maintain consistency.\n3. Test access: After correcting the folder name, try accessing the articles again to confirm the issue is resolved.\n4. Clear cache and perform hard refresh:\n\n   a. Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect to open the developer tools menu.\n\n   b. Right-click the browser's reload button and choose Hard reload or Empty cache and Hard reload.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n Provide the following details:\n\n* Screenshots or video recordings of the subfolder hosting page.\n* Information about any recent changes to your website or system settings.\n* An exported CSV file from the article redirect rule feature.\n\nThe platform where project members manage and create content for the knowledge base.

    "heading": "Determining editors while importing .docx files",
    "text": "## Determining editors while importing .docx files\n\nWhen importing articles from Word files, the editor used will be based on your selection in the Knowledge base portal settings. Follow these steps to check or change your editor selection:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Knowledge base portal** > **General** > **Editor**.\n2. Select the editor to determine how articles are imported:\n\n   1. Choose Markdown or WYSIWYG editors to import Word files using the WYSIWYG editor.\n   2. Choose the Advanced WYSIWYG editor to import Word files using the Advanced WYSIWYG editor.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**What is the best practice for managing large documents in the Advanced WYSIWYG editor?**\n\nAs a best practice, split large documents into multiple articles for better performance and easier management. For instance, if you are importing content from a Word file, you can use the [**Import Word File into Multiple Articles**](/help/docs/article-import-from-word-files) feature for a more efficient workflow.\n\n**What is the maximum file size for .docx files that can be imported?**\n\nThe .docx file size should be less than 15MB. If your Word file exceeds this limit, you will get an error saying, ‘*File size can’t be larger than 15 MB*’ and you will need to split the file into smaller parts before attempting to import the file again.\n\n**Can I import multiple .docx files at once?**\n\nYou can import only one .docx at a time. However, during the upload, you can choose to import it as either a single article or multiple articles.\n\n**Is it possible to import Word files using the Markdown editor?**\n\nNo, importing Word files (.docx) is not supported in the Markdown editor.\n\n**Why am I facing an error while importing a Word document into Document360?**\n\nThere are several reasons for errors when importing Word documents into Document360:\n\n1. **Missing or empty headers in the Table of Contents (TOC)**\n\nIf your document contains missing or empty headers in the TOC section, this can cause an error saying “*An item with the same key has already been added*” during the import process. To resolve this, remove any empty or missing headers from the TOC and then try importing the file again. Once corrected, the import should work as expected.\n\n2. **Firewall blocking the upload**\n\nAnother potential issue could be related to your network firewall. If your firewall is blocking the upload, you might receive an object error. In such cases, ensuring that the Word document upload is allowed in your firewall settings should resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Password-protected or restricted files**\n\nWord files that are password-protected or restricted to specific users cannot be imported. Ensure the file is accessible to everyone.\n\n4. **Conflicting styles between Microsoft Word and Google Docs**\n\nIf a Word file was created in Microsoft Word and later modified in Google Docs, changes to the heading styles in Google Docs can result in duplicate or conflicting styles. This occurs because Microsoft Word and Google Docs handle styles differently, leading to mismatched style tags. To resolve this:\n\na. After uploading the Word document to Google Docs, apply the default Google Docs styles to the document.  \nb. This will reset all styles to Google Docs' default settings, removing any duplicated or conflicting styles.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n**Why do I see the error “You have reached the maximum number of articles you can have in a project”?**\n\nThis error occurs when the number of articles in your project exceeds the allowed limit. If you are importing a Word file, Document360 uses heading tags to divide the file into multiple articles. For example, if the Word file generates 10 articles, but the target category has a soft limit that allows fewer than 10 articles, this error may occur. As a solution,\n\n1. Review the heading tags in your Word file to understand how the content is structured and split into articles.\n2. Adjust the heading structure in the Word file to reduce the number of articles generated during the import.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n<a id=\"publishing-an-article\"></a>",

Retrieve the image URL from the article’s **code view** in the Knowledge base portal or by inspecting the element in the Knowledge base site.\n2. Open the image URL in a browser.\n3. If it results in a **404 error**, the image may have been deleted, moved, or renamed.\n4. Ensure the image file still exists at the same path and with the same name.\n5. As a best practice:\n\n   1.

This ensures image stability and prevents broken image links if the image is removed or renamed in the future.\n\n#### Can I customize the appearance of the inserted images?\n\nYes, you can customize the alignment, size, and style of inserted images to suit your preferences and optimize the visual presentation within your articles.\n\n#### How can I ensure accessibility for visually impaired users when adding images?\n\nYou can provide alternative text (alt text) for each image, which helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired users and improves search engine optimization (SEO) for your Knowledge base.\n\n#### How can I add icons in line with text?\n\nTo add icons in the markdown editor, simply paste the HTML code snippet of the icon wherever you want it to appear in your text. For example, use `<nor class=\"fa-light fa-comment\"></nor>` for a comment icon.\n\nIf you are using the advanced WYSIWYG editor, place the cursor where you want the icon, switch to code view, and paste the same HTML code snippet. After pasting, save the file and switch back to the regular view. You should now see the icon in line with your text. You can find these icon snippets on websites like FontAwesome.\n\n#### Will images copied from any external source that are pasted into Document360 be permanently stored? If yes, what happens when the external source is deleted?\n\nIf images from any external source are copied and pasted into Document360, they will be stored in the Document360 Drive.

    "text": "## **Effect of Machine translation on Hyperlinks**\n\nWhen an article is translated, all internal hyperlinks in the original language are updated to link to the corresponding translated articles in the new/draft state.\n\n**For example:** An article in English contains internal links to other articles. When translated to French, those links will redirect to the French versions of the linked articles.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> To avoid broken links in translated articles, ensure that article slugs are consistent across languages.\n\n> For example, if the English article has the slug `/getting-started`, use the same slug for the translated version (e.g., `/getting-started` for German). This will help maintain link consistency. This is because when you add a redirect rule, the hyperlink URL text for English language is `docs/en/article_slug` and for German language is `docs/de/article_slug`.\n\n---\n\n### Types of URLs\n\n#### Absolute path/URL\n\nAn Absolute path/URL includes the entire web address, from the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) to the domain name and the path within the site. It is the complete address required to access a specific webpage, regardless of the site you are currently on. An absolute URL is used when linking to external websites or when you want to specify the full address of a page.\n\n**For example**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/v3/overview/interface`\n\n#### Relative path/URL\n\nA Relative path/URL is a shortened version of the URL that only specifies the location after the domain. It assumes that the link is within the same site and shares the same root domain. The relative path always starts with a forward slash (`/`). It is commonly used for internal links within the same site.\n\nIn Document360, relative paths are used in several places, such as the linking feature in the editor, article redirect rules, tag redirect rules, and the ticket deflector.\n\n**For example**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/v3/overview/interface`\n\nRelative path: `/v3/overview/interface`\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### How do I link to an existing article in my Knowledge base?\n\nHighlight the text you want to link, click on the **Link** () icon in the editor toolbar, type the article name in the search field, select the article, and click **Insert**.\n\n#### Can I link to headings within the same article?\n\nYes, you can link to headings (H2, H3, H4) within the same article using the hyperlink () tool in the editor.\n\n#### Do hyperlinks get auto-updated when I translate an article?\n\nYes, when you translate an article, all hyperlinks in the default language will direct to the respective translated language in the new article.\n\n#### How can I link a new article to another article before it gets published?\n\nYou can link new unpublished articles to other articles before publishing them by following these steps:\n\n1. Hover over the desired text in the editor and click the **Insert link** () icon.\n2. In the **Search & link to existing article** dropdown, enter the name of the new article and select it.\n3. If needed, check the **Open in a new tab**option to have the link open in a new tab.\n4. Once finished, click **Insert**.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Until you publish the linked new article, the link will be in a broken state.\n\n#### Does an article heading hyperlink still work when I change the heading name?\n\nNo, hyperlinks would not work when you change the heading name. For example, if you have added a hyperlink for the H3 heading as “Markdown editor”, and later you change the H3 heading to \"The Markdown editor\", then the hyperlink would not work.\n\nVisit this [link](https://docs.document360.com/docs/linking-to-other-articles#does-an-article-heading-hyperlink-still-work-when-i-change-the-heading-name) to find a workaround.\n\n**Bookmark links**, also known as internal hyperlinks or cross-references, allow readers to navigate to specific sections within the same document or webpage.

When you directly update a heading, both the heading link and name are updated. However, to change the heading without affecting the heading link, you need to update the HTML tag for the heading ID.\n\nTypically, an H2 heading is formatted as `<h2>Heading name</h2>`. To separate the heading link from the name, you can modify the tag as `<h2><a name=\"heading-link\"></a>Heading name</h2>`.\n\n> For example, you want to update the H2 heading name 'How Risk Analytics Works' to 'Risk Analytics'\n>\n> * Your current heading tag would be `<h2>How Risk Analytics Works</h2>`\n> * Replace it with `<h2><a name=\"How-Risk-Analytics-Works\"></a>How Risk Analytics Works</h2>`  \n>    Heading link - `How-Risk-Analytics-Works`  \n>    Heading name - `How Risk Analytics Works`\n> * Now change the heading name to Risking analytics, and don't change the heading link  \n>   `<h2><a name=\"How-Risk-Analytics-Works\"></a>Risk Analytics</h2>`\n> * If you have added a hyperlink for this heading, it will work fine even after changing the heading name. This is because the heading link is kept the same.\n\n---",
    "summary": "## Effect of changing an article heading on Hyperlinks\n\nTLDR:\n- Changing the heading of an article will break existing hyperlinks that point to that heading.\n- To avoid this, you can separate the heading link and the heading name by using a specific HTML tag structure: `<h2><a name=\"heading-link\"></a>Heading name</h2>`.\n- This way, you can update the heading name without affecting the heading link, and existing hyperlinks will continue to work."

While setting up a redirect rule is optional, it is recommended.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What is the default URL format for an article?\n\nThe default URL format for an article is based on the article title, converted into a slug. For example, if the article title is '`This is a really good content`', the resulting URL would be: `docs.yourcompany.com/[project version]/docs/this-is-really-good-content`.\n\n#### Does changing the article title automatically change the slug?\n\nNo, changing an article’s title does not automatically change the article slug.\n\n#### Is it necessary to apply a redirect rule when changing the slug?\n\nWhile applying a redirect rule is optional, it is recommended to ensure that any links to the old slug remain functional, avoiding broken links.\n\n#### Why use special characters like ä, ö, ü in URLs?\n\nSpecial characters like **ä**, **ö**, and **ü** are often part of words in languages such as German. When creating URLs for knowledge base articles or other web content, using these characters can make the URL:\n\n1. **More intuitive:** The URL reflects the exact title or content of the article, making it easier for users to understand.\n2. **Language-specific:** It preserves the linguistic integrity of terms or phrases specific to a language.\n3. **SEO-friendly:** Search engines can associate the URL more accurately with the content, improving visibility for users searching in that language.\n\nHowever, due to technical encoding requirements, these characters must be properly percent-encoded to function correctly in web links. Always copy URLs from the portal to ensure they work as expected when shared.\n\n#### Why do URLs with special characters (e.g., ä, ö, ü) break when shared?\n\nWhen URLs contain special characters like **ä**, **ö**, or **ü**, they need to be percent-encoded for proper handling in web links. If these characters are not encoded, the URLs may break when shared or accessed, resulting in errors. This behavior is consistent across all browsers and messaging tools.\n\n1. **Copy the URL from the Document360 portal:**  \n   Always copy the URL directly from the **portal** instead of from the browser's address bar. This ensures that the encoded URL remains intact when shared.\n2. **Browser behavior:**\n\n   * When you paste the URL in a browser, the percent-encoded characters may be decoded automatically.\n   * This is normal behavior and does not impact the functionality if the link is used directly from the portal.\n\n   By copying the link from the portal, the encoded characters remain intact, allowing the link to work as expected when shared with others.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n#### Is it possible to change the URL of articles to numbers instead of the title?\n\nYes, in Document360, you can change an article’s URL to use numbers instead of the title:\n\n1. Navigate to the desired article.\n2. Click the slug field provided next to the article status badge.\n3. Update the necessary changes in the field provided under **URL Slug**.\n4. Click **Update** to save the changes.\n\n<a id=\"article-tags\"></a>",

This makes the crawl easier as the sitemap contains all the URLs of the site.\n\n---\n\n### Restricting a specific search engine from crawling\n\n```\nUser-agent: Bingbot \nDisallow: /\n\n```\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy\n\n> The above Robots.txt file is defined to disallow the Bingbot.\n\n`User-agent: Bingbot` - Specifies the crawler from the Bing search engine.  \n`Disallow: /` - Restricts Bingbot from crawling the site.\n\n---\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n* **Include links** to the most important pages.\n* **Block links** to pages that do not provide any value.\n* Add the sitemap location in the **Robots.txt** file.\n* A Robots.txt file cannot be added twice. Please check the basic guidelines from [Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/create-robots-txt#format_location) documentation for more information.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> A web crawler, also known as a Spider or Spiderbot, is a program or script that automatically navigates the web and collects information about various websites. Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yandex use crawlers to replicate a site's information on their servers.\n>\n> Crawlers open new tabs and scroll through website content, just like a user viewing a webpage. Additionally, crawlers collect data or metadata from the website and other entities (such as links on a page, broken links, sitemaps, and HTML code) and send it to the servers of their respective search engine. Search engines use this recorded information to index search results effectively.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**How do I remove my Document360 project from the Google search index?**\n\nTo exclude the entire project from the Google search index:\n\n1.

This occurs because the HTML content of the article exceeds the character limit of 50,000 set by the Azure Translation service. Articles with a large number of tables or complex HTML elements are more prone to exceeding this limit, as these elements contribute significantly to the overall character count.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Open the code view of the article you are trying to translate.\n2. Copy the entire HTML content of the article.\n3. Use a character counting tool to determine the total number of characters in the HTML content.\n4. If the character count exceeds 50,000, split the article content into smaller sections and create multiple articles.\n5. Apply machine translation to the smaller articles separately to proceed with the translation.\n\n![Encountering “Error occurred: Unable to connect the Translate API\" message while translating an article.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/ScreenGIF-Troubleshooting_Unable_to_connect_the_Translate_API.gif)\n\n### Latest content in the main language not reflected in secondary languages\n\nUpdates made to the main language will not automatically reflect in other languages. You must manually initiate the translation process using the Machine translation feature.\n\nWhen an article is created in the main language, its structure is automatically replicated in secondary languages, but the content itself is not transferred.\n\n**Steps to resolve:** To update the content in secondary languages, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **All articles** () section in the main language.\n2. Select the article you want to translate into secondary languages.\n3. Click **Machine translation**.\n\n   The **Translate to other languages** panel will appear.\n4. Select the desired languages.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> * The translating article(s) will switch to the Advanced WYSIWYG editor and cannot be reverted.\n> * Articles in New or Draft status in secondary languages will be overwritten by the latest version from the main language.\n\n5.

Once you have finished translating, you can mark them as translated.\n\n#### Is there a limit on how many articles I can translate at once?\n\nNo, you can translate multiple articles simultaneously as long as you have sufficient machine translation credits.\n\n#### What happens if my article exceeds the character limit for machine translation?\n\nIf an article exceeds the 50,000-character limit, machine translation cannot proceed. To enable translation, reduce the character count. Note that the character count is based on the HTML content, ensuring formatting is preserved across all languages during translation.\n\n#### Can I revert back to the original state after machine translation?\n\nOnce an article is machine translated, you can change its status back to \"Needs translation,\" but the original content is not retained. Be sure to keep a backup of the original content if needed.\n\n#### Are there additional costs for using machine translation?\n\nMachine translation is included in your subscription plan. However, exceeding your character limit will incur additional charges.\n\n#### What happens to articles in other languages when I create a new article in the main language?\n\nWhen you create a new article in the main language, corresponding articles are created in other languages (e.g., German, Spanish) but without content. You will need to translate the content using the Machine translation feature in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n#### What happens when I add a new language to the project?\n\nWhen a new language is added after content has been drafted in the main language, the content from the main language is automatically replicated in the newly added language's articles. To translate these articles, navigate to them and click **Needs translation** to complete the translation.\n\n#### Why are some articles empty in other languages?\n\nIf the desired languages were already added to the project before drafting the article in the main language, the content will not be automatically replicated. You must translate the content manually via **All articles**().\n\n#### How do I delete an article in a specific language without affecting other languages?\n\nWhen you delete an article in any specific language, it will also be deleted in the main language and other languages, as articles are linked across languages.\n\nTo avoid this, you can **hide** the article in that specific language:\n\n1. Navigate to the desired article in that language.\n2. Use the **Hide** () option to ensure it does not appear in the Knowledge base for users in that language.\n\n   This way, the article will remain available in other languages within your project.\n\n#### How do I delete all articles in one specific language without deleting other languages?\n\nIf you want to delete all articles in a specific language but retain the articles in other languages:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings**() > **Knowledge base portal** > **Localization & Workspaces** >**Localization & Workspaces**in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Hover over the desired workspace and click the **Edit**() icon.\n\n   The **Edit workspace** panel will appear.\n3. Navigate to the desired language and click the **More** () icon.\n4.

Here are some best practices to help you craft strong meta descriptions and titles:\n\n#### Best practices for SEO meta descriptions\n\n1. **Keep it concise (around 155-160 characters):** Meta descriptions should be brief yet informative. They are snippets that appear in search engine results, so ensure they’re clear and concise.\n2. **Include relevant keywords:** Incorporate primary and secondary keywords naturally, reflecting the core topic of the article to improve discoverability.\n3. **Align with user intent:** Ensure the meta description answers what your target audience might be looking for. This helps increase click-through rates by attracting the right audience.\n4. **Make it actionable:** Use calls to action like “Learn more,” “Discover,” or “Get started” to encourage users to click on your link.\n5. **Unique for every page:** Ensure every page on your website has a unique meta description to avoid duplicate content issues.\n6. **Avoid keyword stuffing:** Overloading the meta description with too many keywords can make it seem unnatural and may negatively impact SEO.\n\n> **PRO TIP**\n>\n> Focus on clarity and relevance. Even though meta descriptions don’t directly impact rankings, they play a significant role in improving click-through rates.\n\n#### Best practices for SEO titles\n\n1. **Optimal length (50-60 characters):** Keep your title under 60 characters to ensure it doesn’t get cut off in search results.\n2. **Include primary keywords:** The title should include your primary keywords, preferably at the beginning, to improve relevance for search engines.\n3. **Reflect the article’s content:** The title should accurately represent the article’s subject matter to avoid misleading users or increasing bounce rates.\n4. **Make it engaging:** Write compelling titles that spark interest. Use power words or questions to attract user attention.\n5. **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure your title is clear, straightforward, and free from unnecessary repetition of words.\n6. **Brand inclusion (optional):** You can add your brand’s name at the end of the title to improve brand visibility, but only if space allows without truncating essential keywords.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Why is an SEO description generator essential?\n\nUse the SEO description generator to generate the meta descriptions for your articles and category pages effortlessly. This AI (Artificial Intelligence) powered feature will generate the best meta description for your articles and category pages based on the content.\n\n#### What is a meta/SEO description?\n\nA meta description or SEO description summarizes an article/category page.

Consistency is key to making sure similar content is grouped appropriately. For instance, decide in advance whether to tag articles based on topics, products, or user roles and follow this approach throughout.\n2. **Use specific and relevant tags**: Avoid broad or vague tags that don't provide enough context. Focus on tags that directly relate to the article's core content. For example, instead of using a general tag like \"Update,\" specify \"Security Update\" or \"Feature Update.\"\n3. **Limit the number of tags**: While tags are important, applying too many can be counterproductive. Aim to use 3-5 key tags per article that best describe the content. This keeps searches focused and avoids cluttering the tagging system.\n4. **Review and update tags regularly**: As your content evolves, review and update your tags to ensure they remain relevant. Retire or modify tags that are outdated or no longer applicable to ensure efficient content retrieval.\n5. **Group content using tags**: Tags allow you to group related content, improving navigation. For example, you could tag all articles related to \"Onboarding,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" or \"Product Features\" to create clusters of related content, helping users easily find what they need.\n6. **Leverage the AI tag recommender**: Use the AI Tag Recommender feature to ensure consistent and relevant tagging across your articles. The AI's suggestions will help maintain uniformity, which is especially useful when different team members are managing content.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Who can generate the Tags?\n\nTeam accounts with the following permission combinations can generate the tags:\n\n* Update article settings + Manage Tags\n* Publish article + Manage Tags\n* Update article settings + Publish article + Manage Tags\n\n#### Can I generate the tags for multiple articles in one go?\n\nCurrently, you can generate the tags for one article at a time.\n\n#### Does using the AI tag recommender feature spend credits?\n\nNo, the AI tag recommender feature does not consume any Eddy AI credits. This feature currently offers unlimited usage without any credit limitations.\n\n#### Can I still add the Tags manually?\n\nYes, you can add the Tags manually.\n\n#### Can I turn off the Tag recommendations?\n\nNo, you cannot turn off the Tag recommendations.\n\n<a id=\"ai-related-articles-recommender\"></a>",

    "heading": "How to write GenAI friendly content",
    "text": "## How to write GenAI friendly content\n\nTo write AI-friendly content for your articles, it's important to structure your information in a way that improves clarity, readability, and searchability. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n### 1. **Use clear and concise headings**\n\n* **Headings (H1, H2, H3)**: Organize content using clear and descriptive headings. This helps AI understand the hierarchy and structure of your article.\n* **Keyword-rich headings**: Ensure your headings reflect the content of the section. For example, instead of \"Introduction,\" use \"Introduction to Cloud Storage Solutions.\"\n\n### 2. **Write short and focused paragraphs**\n\n* **Keep sentences short**: Aim for sentences of 15-20 words. Avoid complex sentences as they can confuse AI processing.\n* **One idea per paragraph**: Ensure each paragraph covers one idea to make it easy for AI to extract key information.\n\n### 3. **Include tables for structured data**\n\n* **Well-labeled tables**: Use tables to present structured data, making it easier for AI to scan and interpret. Clearly label rows and columns with descriptive headers.\n* **Consistent formatting**: Ensure the table is formatted consistently for better AI recognition (e.g., avoid merged cells or irregular formatting).\n\n### 4. **Incorporate code snippets carefully**\n\n* **Use clean and well-commented code**: When including code snippets, use standard formatting and comment on key sections. AI can use comments to understand the context.\n* **Use appropriate syntax highlighting**: This helps AI differentiate code from regular text.\n\n### 5. **Use bullet points and numbered lists**\n\n* **Break up information**: Bullet points and lists help organize content and make it easier for AI to break down and extract key points.\n* **Limit list length**: Keep lists concise, ideally under 5-7 points, to avoid overwhelming the AI and readers.\n\n### 6. **Include descriptive alt text for images**\n\n**Alt text and captions**: Always include descriptive alt text and captions for images. This allows AI to understand and process the context of the image.\n\n### 7. **Provide clear, contextual links**\n\n* **Internal links**: Link to relevant internal articles using clear anchor text. Avoid generic phrases like “click here.”\n* **Anchor text**: Use descriptive anchor text that informs AI of the linked content, such as “Read more about cloud storage security best practices.”\n\n### 8. **Ensure SEO best practices**\n\n* **Keyword optimization**: Use keywords naturally within headings, subheadings, and content. Avoid keyword stuffing.\n* **Meta descriptions**: Write clear, relevant meta descriptions with keywords to help AI rank the content effectively.\n\n### 9. Use business glossary terms consistently\n\n* **Consistent terminology:** Make sure to use terms from your business glossary consistently throughout your articles. This helps AI identify and relate key terms across your content, improving searchability and comprehension.\n* **Define key terms:** If a term might be unfamiliar to readers, include a brief definition or link to your business glossary. This ensures both AI and users understand the context of specialized terms.\n* **Standardize abbreviations:** Always use standardized abbreviations or acronyms from your business glossary. This ensures AI correctly identifies and categorizes key terms.\n\n### 10. **Write for humans first**\n\n* **Conversational tone**: AI tends to perform better with content that is written in a human-friendly tone, as it improves engagement and contextual understanding.\n* **Natural language**: Use natural, everyday language. Avoid jargon or overly complex terms unless absolutely necessary, and provide definitions for technical terms.\n\n### 11. **Monitor AI-generated content**\n\n**Review and revise**: If you're using AI tools like AI writers or content generators, always review the output to ensure it meets your quality standards and reads naturally.\n\n---\n\n#### Recommendations for optimizing your experience as a contributor with Eddy AI\n\nWriting documentation that is easily understood by AI (Eddy AI) involves incorporating clear language, structured formatting, and adherence to specific guidelines.\n\n1. **Use clear and focused language**\n\n   Express ideas in a straightforward manner, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n   Break down complex concepts into simpler, digestible parts.\n\n   Define technical terms or provide links to detailed explanations.\n2. **Structured formatting**\n\n   Use clear headings and subheadings to organize information.\n\n   Employ bullet points and numbered lists to present step-by-step instructions.\n\n   Highlight key points using bold or italics for better parsing by bots.\n3. **Consistent terminology**\n\n   Maintain consistency in the use of terminology to facilitate understanding.\n\n   Use the Glossary feature in Document360 to achieve this.\n\n   Avoid ambiguity by using specific and standardized terms.\n4. **Avoid jargon overload**\n\n   Minimize the use of industry-specific jargon unless essential.\n\n   If technical terms are necessary, provide brief explanations or context.\n5. **Elaborative text content**\n\n   Elaborate the content and clearly specify the content's intent.\n\n   If you use multimedia content, ensure that you provide a text explanation of what the media is trying to convey.\n\n   Break down information into shorter paragraphs for better readability.\n\n   Provide explicit answers to questions in the form of FAQs to minimize inaccurate answers by \"Eddy AI.\" AI bots tend to hallucinate when the content is not elaborate or explicitly mentioned.\n6. **Provide context and example**\n\n   Offer real-world examples to illustrate technical concepts.\n\n   Provide context to help the reader understand the purpose and application of the information.\n7. **Use descriptive headings**\n\n   Craft descriptive headings that accurately represent the content.\n\n   Headings should act as a guide, summarizing the content beneath.\n\n   Avoid repetitive heading text in the same article.\n8. **Test with \"Eddy AI\"**\n\n   Utilize \"Eddy AI\" to analyze your content for clarity and coherence.\n\n   Make adjustments based on feedback from these tools.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can create and manage documentation that is not only comprehensible to humans but also easily processed and understood by AI and NLP bots like \"Eddy AI\".\n\n<a id=\"prompt-engineering-tips\"></a>",

    "heading": "Best practices for prompt engineering with Eddy AI",
    "text": "## Best practices for prompt engineering with Eddy AI\n\n**1. Be clear and specific in your prompts**\n\nWhen working with Eddy AI, the more precise your instructions, the better. For example, instead of asking for a “brief summary,” be specific about what you want, such as, “Generate a 100-word summary about the benefits of Document360’s knowledge base.”\n\nIf your content involves complex technical details, break it into smaller, more manageable requests. This helps Eddy AI deliver focused, relevant outputs.\n\n**2. Ask for step-by-step instructions**\n\nEddy AI can be very effective in generating procedural content when you clearly specify the task. Instead of just saying, \"Explain how to publish an article,\" a more refined prompt would be, \"List the steps to publish an article in Document360, including where to click and how to configure settings.\"\n\n**3. Structure your prompts for comparisons**\n\nStructure your prompt accordingly if you need content that compares features or options. For example, “Compare the key differences between Document360’s private and public knowledge base setups” will guide Eddy AI to focus on generating a detailed comparison.\n\n**4. Focus on article summaries**\n\nWhen summarizing articles, especially longer ones, ask Eddy AI to create summaries based on specific sections or categories. For instance, “Summarize the benefits and limitations section of the article on Document360’s multi-language support.” This will help generate more concise and useful summaries.\n\n**5. Include context for recommendations**\n\nContext is critical when asking Eddy AI to generate recommendations or suggestions.

This saves time by allowing you to derive aspects from existing templates.\n\n#### What happens if I delete a template that I no longer need?\n\nDeleting a template removes it from the library but doesn't affect articles already created using that template. Your existing content remains unaffected.\n\n#### Is the template I create available for other team members to use?\n\nOnce you create or save an article as a template, other team members can view and use the template in the Template library.\n\n#### Does updating a template affect the article created from it?\n\nUpdating a template does not affect articles that were created from that template. When you create an article from a template, a local copy of the content is saved in the article. It is isolated from the template content.\n\n#### Can I clone templates used in articles to other languages?\n\nNo, templates cannot be cloned to different languages in Document360. Currently, templates can only be cloned within the same language.  \nIf you need to use a template in a different language:\n\n1. Manually recreate the template in the desired language by copying its structure and content.\n2. Translate the content into the desired language.\n3.

All imported data will be added to this new workspace.\n\nImporting the ZIP file does not affect your project’s settings. Be sure to back up any important data before proceeding with the import.\n\n#### What happens if I import a ZIP file into the same project it was exported from?\n\nIf you import a ZIP file into the same project from which it was exported, any articles in the ZIP file that match existing articles in the project will be overwritten with the version from the ZIP file. Articles that do not exist in the ZIP file will remain unchanged.\n\n#### How do I find the Workspace slug URL for my project?\n\n1. Navigate to the desired **Document360** project.\n2. Go to **Settings**() > **Knowledge base portal** > **Localization & Workspaces**.\n3. In the **Localization & Workspaces** tab, hover over the desired workspace and click the **Edit**() icon.\n\n   The **Edit workspace** panel will appear.\n4. In the **Slug URL** field, locate the slug URL for the workspace.\n\n#### Can I import only ZIP files for Document360 projects? Are ZIP files from other platforms supported?\n\nNo, ZIP files from other platforms are not supported. Only project export ZIP files generated in **Document360** can be used while importing content to a project.\n\n#### What is the maximum size for Document360 project ZIP files I can upload?\n\n**Document360** project ZIP files can be uploaded up to a maximum size of 1 GB.\n\n#### Why did my Document360 export file fail to import?\n\nThere are several reasons why your **Document360** export file may fail to import:\n\n1. **Unsupported features**  \n   If the export file contains workspaces, languages, or other features not supported in your current Document360 plan, the upload will fail. Hover over the info icon for details on unsupported features.\n2. **Mismatched slugs and workspace names**  \n   The workspace names and slugs in the source and destination projects do not match. Ensure these align before attempting the upload.\n3. **Incorrect file format**  \n   The imported file must follow the required format for the import process. Verify the structure and ensure it meets the necessary guidelines.\n4. **Missing languages in destination**  \n   If the import file contains languages that are not available in the destination workspace, the upload will not proceed. Add the required languages to the destination workspace before uploading.\n\n![Screenshot-Updated_importing_document360_successfull](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot-Import_zip_file_error.png)\n\n<a id=\"migrating-documentation-from-another-knowledge-base-platform\"></a>",

This will enable any URLs from your previous platform to redirect to documentation in your current knowledge base in Document360.\n\nFollow the below steps to set up a redirect rule for the subfolder URL path:\n\n1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Article redirect rules** > **New redirect**.\n2. Select Redirect type as **Replace with**.\n3. Enter the old subfolder path in the **Source path** field.\n4. Enter the subfolder path you want to redirect in the **Destination URL** field.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n> **For example**, you want to redirect the subfolder path `/help/customer/` to `/docs/en/` in the URLs `https://docs.churn360.com/help/customer/article_slug`.\n>\n> * Enter `/help/customer/` in the **Source path** field.\n> * Enter `/docs/en/` in the Destination URL field.\n>\n> With the above redirect rule, all the URLs with subfolder path `/help/customer/` in the configured knowledge base domain (`https://docs.churn360.com/`) will be redirected to the subfolder path `/docs/en`.\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\n\n**Why should I set up a redirect rule when I change the subfolder path?**\n\nYour readers would have bookmarked the articles in your old knowledge base. Your articles would be backlinked in internal and external articles as references. So, when you do not set up a redirect rule for these URLs, it will lead to a 404 error page. 404 error pages play a negative role in google search index which will pull down google search results and mainly cause a bad reader experience.\n\n<a id=\"pdf-design-templates\"></a>",

Accessing the article after this period will count as another view. |\n| **Total reads** | An article read is recorded when a user engages through clicking, scrolling, and spending time on the page. The user has to perform all these three actions to count as one read.   * **Scrolling**: At least a single scroll is needed for a valid read. * **Time spent**: Time is tracked only after 40 seconds spent on the article. If a user becomes idle (e.g., stops interacting) for some time or switches tabs, the timer pauses and resumes upon return. * **Session tracking**: Time spent revisiting the same article within 24 hours in the same browser session is added to the previous session's total.

In contrast, the Top articles section lists the top 5 most viewed and read articles on your knowledge base, consolidated for the selected period.\n\n#### **Which team account roles in Document360 can access the Analytics section? Is it limited to Admins and Owners?**\n\nIn Document360, Admins, Owners, and Contributors can access the Analytics section if their content role is Editor or draft writer.\n\nIf you want to restrict team accounts from accessing the Analytics section, you can create a custom portal and content role and uncheck the \"Analytics\" permission. This will prevent specific users from accessing Analytics.\n\nWhen creating a new team account or modifying an existing one, assign this custom content role to ensure users with this role can't access the Analytics section.\n\n> For more details on creating a custom content role, read the [Roles and permissions](/help/docs/roles) article.\n\n#### **How can I find the file size I am trying to export?**\n\nCurrently, Document360 does not display the file size before export. After downloading the file, you can check the size on your local device.\n\n#### How does the analytics track read counts for smaller articles that do not require scrolling?\n\nFor shorter articles where scrolling is not necessary, a read is counted if a user clicks on the article and spends at least 60 seconds engaging with the content. Even without scrolling, this interaction is recognized as a valid read based on the read time shown in the article.\n\nA chart legend represents data series in a chart, using colors or symbols to differentiate them.

You can contact our customer support if you need to increase this limit.\n\n#### How can I prevent specific example links from being flagged as broken in the link status report?\n\nIf you have examples or placeholder links in your articles that are being detected as broken links in the analytics, you can exclude these links from validation to avoid confusion.\n\n1. Navigate to **Analytics** () > **Link status**.\n2. On the **Link status** page, click **Manage links** in the top-right corner.\n3. In the **Manage links** page, by default, the **All links** tab will be selected.\n4. Select the links you want to **ignore** from the list or use the search bar to find them.\n5. Once you have selected the desired links, click **Ignore** ().\n\n   The ignored links will be moved to the Ignored tab and will no longer appear in link validation reports.\n\nIf you want to include these links back in the validation process later:\n\n1.

When users begin filling out the ticket form, the system suggests helpful articles that might answer their questions, deflecting the need to raise a support request.\n\n#### How does the ticket deflector work?\n\nThe ticket deflector suggests relevant knowledge base articles based on keywords from the user's query or question. As users type into the form, the system automatically searches the knowledge base and displays suggested articles that may provide the solution, potentially preventing ticket submission.\n\n#### What does the ‘*Answered from Knowledge Base’* metric represent?\n\nThe Answered from Knowledge Base metric shows the number of queries that were successfully resolved by the suggested articles in your knowledge base, without the user needing to submit a ticket. This helps measure the effectiveness of your knowledge base in reducing support requests.\n\n#### How can I improve the effectiveness of the ticket deflector?\n\nTo improve the effectiveness of the ticket deflector:\n\n* Ensure your knowledge base is up to date with accurate and comprehensive articles.\n* Use clear and relevant keywords in your articles to improve searchability.\n* Regularly review and update the **Frequently selected questions** section to better address common user queries.\n* Analyze the **Search Success Rate** to identify gaps in your knowledge base and add or improve articles accordingly.\n\n#### How is the Search success rate calculated?\n\nThe **Search Success Rate** represents the percentage of searches that returned a relevant article for the user's query. It compares the total number of searches performed with the number of successful searches that resulted in the user finding a helpful article.\n\nA chart legend represents data series in a chart, using colors or symbols to differentiate them.

    "text": "## How to change the default widget icon?\n\nYou can easily replace the default Knowledge Base widget icon with a custom one that fits your brand’s design. This gives a more cohesive look to your website or app.\n\n### **Creating a custom button**\n\nTo add a custom button that interacts with the Knowledge Base widget:\n\n1. Add a new HTML element, a button, for example, anywhere on your page.\n\n   ```\n    <button id=\"doc360_help_btn\" class=\"btn hide\"><span>Help!</span></button>\n   ```\n\n   XML\n\n   Copy\n2.

This will be executed by [URL mapping](/help/docs/url-mapping) if a valid map is found to hide Knowledge Base widget. These functions handle the button's visibility based on the Knowledge Base widget’s state or URL mapping.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The show and hide callbacks are only necessary if you’re hiding the widget on specific pages using URL mapping.\n\n### Integrating the callback functions\n\nTo make the widget recognize your custom callbacks, modify the Knowledge Base widget’s JavaScript snippet (found in the widget settings):\n\n```\n<!-- Document360 Knowledge Base assistant Start -->\n<script>\n    (function (w,d,s,o,f,js,fjs) {\n        w['JS-assistant']=o;w[o] = w[o] || function () { (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments) };\n        js = d.createElement(s), fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n        js.id = o; js.src = f; js.async = 1; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n    }(window, document, 'script', 'mw', 'https://cdn.document360.io/static/js/assistant.js'));\n    mw('init', { apiKey: 'YOUR KEY', \n                   callback:  doc360_callback, \n                   show_callback: doc360_show_callback,  \n                   hide_callback: doc360_hide_callback });\n</script>\n<!-- Document360 Knowledge Base assistant End -->\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n### **Making the button open the widget**\n\nOnce the button is visible, you’ll want it to open the Knowledge Base widget when clicked. You can achieve this with either pure JavaScript or jQuery.\n\n**Using Pure JavaScript:**\n\n```\ndocument.getElementById('doc360_help_btn').addEventListener('click', function () { \n    document.getElementById('document360-assistant-iframe').contentDocument.getElementById('doc360-button').click();\n});\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n**Using jQuery:**\n\n```\n$('#doc360_help_btn').click(function() {\n    $('#document360-assistant-iframe').contents().find('#doc360-button').click();\n}); \n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n### **Customizing the button’s appearance**\n\nApply any custom CSS to the button to match your website’s branding.

What is regex?\n\nRegex, short for \"regular expression,\" is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern used to match and manipulate text strings.\n\n> For example, you can use regex to configure a single URL mapping for 20 articles with similar URLs.  \n>  For instance, consider a scenario where you wish to configure URL mapping for the following articles with the base URL '`https://example.com/docs/drive`':\n>\n> * `https://example.com/drive-General`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-settings`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionA`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionB`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionC`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionD`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionE`\n>\n> Without regex, you would need to add individual URL mappings for each URL. However, by enabling regex, you can add with a single URL mapping: Select the \"Include path\" option and add `docs/drive` in the URL field. You can use regex to have a more efficient and streamlined mapping process.\n\n---\n\n#### 15. Can I add URL mapping for categories?\n\nYes, you can add URL mapping for categories. It applies only to page and index categories.\n\n---\n\n#### 16. How to remove the Knowledge base widget icon from an article?\n\n1. Go to the **URL mapping** tab of the desired Knowledge base widget (**Knowledge base widget** > **Edit**).\n2. Create a new URL mapping with **Hide** action for the desired article.\n\n---\n\n#### 17. What is the default language behavior of the Knowledge base widget?\n\nThe Knowledge base widget will now open in the default browser language by default. If the default browser language is not available in the Knowledge base widget, the default language of the Knowledge base will appear.\n\n#### 18. How do I restrict the Knowledge base widget to a specific domain?\n\n1. Go to the **Installation & Setup** tab of the desired Knowledge base widget (**Knowledge base widget** > **Edit**).\n2. In the **Style your widget** section, you can find the **Keep your widget secure**.\n3. Enter the domains where you want the Knowledge base widget to display.\n4. Click **Add** > **Save**.\n\n<a id=\"knowledge-base-site-20\"></a>",

    "heading": "Troubleshooting",
    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides step-by-step guidance to address common challenges that you may encounter while managing or accessing your knowledge base site. From website accessibility problems to configuration errors, each solution is tailored to help you quickly identify and resolve potential roadblocks.\n\n### Website fails to load after entering the URL\n\nIf a website is not accessible when you enter a URL, possible causes could be incorrect URL entry, browser cache issues, VPN interference, network problems, server downtime, outdated browsers, or incorrect system date and time settings.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Ensure the website URL is entered correctly.\n2. Reload the page.\n3. Clear browser cache:\n\n   1. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** to open the developer tools menu.\n   2. Right-click the browser's reload button and choose **Hard reload** or **Empty cache**and **Hard reload**.\n4. Check if a VPN is active on your device. Disable the VPN and attempt to access the site again.\n5. Ensure your system's date, time, and time zone are set correctly.\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, consider contacting the support team for further assistance.\n\n### 504 gateway timeout while accessing the site\n\n**Error:** 504 gateway timeout\n\nIf a 504 error occurs while accessing the site, one possible reason could be the sub-folder configuration.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Check recent changes in the web server configuration:\n\n   1. Review the location blocks or configuration files in the webserver for any recent changes.\n   2. If changes are identified, revert them to their previous state.\n2. Verify the sub-folder Configuration:\n\n   1. A change in the sub-folder slug within the Sub-folder Configuration may cause the issue.\n   2. Revert any recent changes to the sub-folder configuration to resolve the issue.\n\n   For more reference on sub-folder configuration, refer to the article on [Hosting Document360 on a sub-directory](https://docs.document360.com/docs/document360-on-a-sub-folder).\n\n### Page unresponsive while editing an article\n\n**Error:** The page isn’t working. example.com redirected you too many times. ERR\\_TOO\\_MANY\\_REDIRECTS.\n\nIf you encounter this error during article editing, possible causes could be an outdated browser cache, overly large articles causing performance issues, missing or improperly closed HTML tags, or excessive redirects due to incorrect configurations in the article.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Clear browser cache:** An outdated or corrupted browser cache can interfere with page functionality. Clear the cache, reload the browser and check if the issue persists.\n2. **Reduce article length:** Large articles with extensive content can cause performance issues. Consider splitting lengthy articles into smaller sections and organizing them under relevant categories to enhance responsiveness.\n3. **Check for missing closed tags:** Ensure all HTML tags in your article have corresponding closing tags, especially in Markdown. Elements like `<table>`, `<div>`, and `<p>` should be properly closed to prevent rendering problems.\n\nThese steps can improve your editing experience and help prevent **Page unresponsive** errors.\n\n### Page isn’t working due to too many redirect**s**\n\n**Error:** Page isn’t working: page redirected too many times\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect JWT Login URL configuration, using the domain URL as the Login URL causing redirect loops, or outdated settings in the JWT configuration.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Check recent changes**: Review any recent updates made to the JWT Login URL in the configuration.\n2. **Correct the Login URL**: Ensure the domain URL is not set as the Login URL. Using the domain URL can cause multiple redirect issues.\n3. **Update JWT configuration**: Remove the incorrect Login URL from the JWT configuration and replace it with the correct one.\n\nFor detailed instructions on configuring JWT, refer to the [JWT article](https://docs.document360.com/docs/configuring-the-jwt-sso).\n\n### Sorry! Project not found during custom domain configuration\n\n**Error:** Sorry! This project does not exist.\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect or missing CNAME record configuration, expired CNAME records in the DNS, or incomplete domain verification in the Document360 portal.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Verify CNAME Record**: Ensure the CNAME record is added correctly and click the 'Verify' button on the custom domain page in the Document360 portal. Once verified, the custom domain will be set up and active immediately.\n2. **Check for CNAME Expiry**: If the CNAME record was updated in the DNS after some time, it may have expired, preventing domain verification and resulting in the error message.\n3. **Reconfigure the Domain**: Reconfigure the custom domain, update the CNAME record, and verify the domain in Document360.\n\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the [custom domain mapping article](https://docs.document360.com/docs/custom-domain-mapping).\n\n### Encountering \"/home/error/\" message while accessing the site\n\n**Error:** /home/error/\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect site configuration, server-side issues, or unresolved errors in the website's backend. You might encounter this error in the URL section after the domain URL.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Contact support**: Reach out to us at [**support@document360.com**](mailto:support@document360.com) with the following details:\n\n   1. A screen share video demonstrating the issue on the page.\n   2. Steps to reproduce the error, if possible.\n2. **Provide HAR file**: Follow the steps outlined in this[guide](https://docs.document360.com/docs/document360-support-generating-a-har-file) to download the har file.\n3. **Share console errors**:\n\n   1. After downloading the har file, click on the ‘console’ tab in your browser's developer tools.\n   2. Take a screenshot of the console errors displayed and include it in your email.\n\n### Icons not rendering correctly on the user site\n\nIn some cases, icons on the user site may not render correctly, especially when there are a large number of icons for different navigations. The primary reason for broken icons is an unintended modification of the FontAwesome family provided by Document360. This occurs when changes to other classes or HTML tags on the user site unintentionally alter the icon font settings.  \nTo avoid this issue,\n\n* Ensure that changes to the site's styling or class definitions do not impact the FontAwesome classes or font family settings.\n* When targeting specific elements, double-check that icon-related styles remain intact and are not overwritten.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n**1. Inspect the broken icon:**\n\n1. Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect the user site.\n2. Click the broken icon using the selector tool to identify the issue.\n\n2. **Check custom CSS:**\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Review any font rules applied to various classes. In some cases, font changes may unintentionally apply to broader classes, affecting the icons.\n3. Ensure font changes are applied only to the specific classes that require them. This will help preserve the default settings for Font Awesome and prevent any unintended impact on icons.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### Knowledge base site loading without CSS styling\n\nThis issue typically occurs when the site is accessed from a network where Document360 domains are blocked or not whitelisted by your company or organization.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Verify if the site works correctly when accessed from a different network. If it does, the issue is likely related to network restrictions.\n2. To resolve this, whitelist the following domains in your network settings to ensure proper access and functionality.\n\n![Image showing domains to whitelist to address troubleshooting](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_ScreenShot-troubleshooting.png)\n\n### Secure connection issues on the knowledge base site\n\n**Error:**\n\n* This site can’t provide a secure connection\n* Your connection isn’t private\n* The connection for this site is not secure\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Check the CAA Record in DNS:**\n\n   1. Verify if a CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) record is added for your knowledge base site in the DNS records.\n   2. If no CAA record is found, inspect the SSL certificate used for the site. Refer to the steps in the provided video for guidance.\n\n2. **Update the CAA Record:**\n\n   1. Based on the SSL certificate provider, add the corresponding CAA record to your DNS.\n   2. For example, if the certificate provider is Let’s Encrypt, add the second CAA record as specified in the instructions. Similarly, ensure the correct CAA record is added for your certificate type.\n\n3. **Reference for CAA Records:**\n\n   Learn more about CAA records and their importance by reviewing the following article:  \n   [CAA Record and Why It Is Needed (SSL-Related)](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9991/38/caa-record-and-why-it-is-needed-ssl-related/#caa_how).\n\n4. **Contact the DNS Provider:**\n\n   If the issue persists during custom domain setup, reach out to your DNS provider to confirm if there are any additional issues.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### Encountering \"ResourceNotFound\" error while accessing the images, files or attachments\n\n**Error**: ResourceNotFound\n\nThis error occurs when the SaaS token is not appended to the file URL in **private** and **mixed projects**. Document360 appends a SaaS token to ensure that only authorized users can access the file.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n* Ensure the SaaS token is appended to the file URL before accessing or sharing the file.\n* Try downloading the file again directly from Document360.\n\n![Error message indicating resource not found in XML file format.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1739344746842.png)\n\n### Encountering \"AuthenticationFailed\" error while accessing images, files, or attachments\n\n**Error:** AuthenticationFailed\n\nThis error occurs when the **SaaS token** has expired in **private** and **mixed projects**.

Change the subfolder path back to the default **“docs”** and save the changes.\n* **Redirection rule:** A redirection rule might be misconfigured, either redirecting the article incorrectly or causing a 404 error.\n\n  1. Go to **Settings** () > **Article redirect rules** and check for any rules applied to the article.\n  2. Validate and remove unnecessary or misconfigured rules.\n* **Incorrect URL:** The URL was mistyped or linked incorrectly. Ensure the article slug is in all lowercase letters.\n\n  **Server issues:** A server problem prevented the page from loading.\n\n#### **What are the best practices to create a 404 page?**\n\nThe best practices for creating a 404 page are:\n\n1. **Keep the design consistent**\n\n* Ensure the 404 page matches the overall look and feel of your website or product.\n* Use the same branding, colors, and fonts to create a seamless experience and avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Use clear and friendly language**\n\n* Avoid overly technical jargon. Use simple, friendly language that lets users know they’re in the right place but the page is unavailable.\n* Acknowledge the error with a human touch.\n\n3. **Offer helpful navigation**\n\n* Provide clear links to guide users back on track:\n\n  + **Homepage**\n  + **Search bar**\n  + **Popular or recommended pages**\n* Consider offering links to **frequently visited sections**, like support, contact, or a knowledge base.\n\n4. **Add a search bar**\n\nGive users the chance to search for what they were trying to find. A well-placed search bar can help them continue their journey seamlessly.\n\n5. **Explain what might have happened**\n\n* Include a short explanation of why the user may have ended up there (e.g., broken link, outdated URL).\n* Keep it light and user-friendly: \"It’s possible the page has been moved or no longer exists.\"\n\n6. **Include a Call-to-Action (CTA)**\n\n* Suggest actions they can take:\n\n  + **Contact support** for help.\n  + **Report the broken link**.\n* For an e-commerce site, offering product recommendations or deals could also be beneficial.\n\n7. **Add a touch of humor or personality**\n\n* Inject some personality with humor or visuals. A light-hearted approach can ease the frustration of hitting an error.\n* Use quirky messaging like: \"Looks like this page is on vacation!\" or visual elements like an illustration.\n\n8. **Make the page functional**\n\n* Ensure any buttons or links on the 404 page are working properly and are easy to locate.\n* Double-check that navigation back to the homepage or other sections is smooth and intuitive.\n\n9. **Add a feedback option**\n\nProvide a link or form to report the issue or give feedback. This can help identify any broken links or common user issues.\n\n10. **Consider SEO**\n\n* Include proper meta tags and an SEO-friendly 404 page that informs search engines of the missing page.\n* Include relevant internal links so search engines can still index your important pages.\n\n11. **Use an eye-catching image or animation**\n\n* Visuals can make the 404 page engaging. You can use custom illustrations, fun animations, or even GIFs to add interest and reduce frustration.\n\n12. **Ensure it’s mobile-friendly**\n\n* Make sure your 404 page is responsive and works well on mobile devices, just like the rest of your site.\n\n<a id=\"access-denied-page\"></a>",

This event triggers when the article content refreshes, ensuring your scripts work seamlessly in the new architecture.\n\n1. Replace any code that relies on page refresh events with a subscription to the `articleload` event.\n2. Use the following code snippet to adapt your custom scripts:\n\n   ```\n   window.addEventListener('articleload', function() {\n     // Your custom JavaScript code here\n   });\n   ```\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   Copy\n3. Test your updated scripts to confirm they function correctly in the SPA environment.\n\n   If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Can custom .css files be applied in Document360?\n\nYes, Document360 provides you the flexibility to apply custom .css files to tailor the appearance and style of your documentation.\n\n#### If we need to cater to multiple brands, would we require a separate workspace for each brand, or can different styles/style sheets be applied to different projects within a workspace?\n\nIf you manage multiple brands, you can either create separate workspaces within a single project or purchase additional projects for each brand. It’s important to note that any CSS added to the project will be applied universally across all workspaces. However, you still have the flexibility to customize the styling of landing pages and other elements for each workspace individually.\n\n<a id=\"css-snippets\"></a>",

    "text": "## Adding an article redirect rule\n\nYou can change an article's URL or slug before or after publishing the article or category page. The URL of an index-type category can also be modified. You can make these changes directly in the article editor.\n\nTo add the article redirect rule, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** ()> **Knowledge base site** > **Article redirect rules** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   The **Article redirect rules** page will appear with a list of existing rules (if any).\n2. Click **New redirect** to create a new redirection rule.\n\n   The **New redirect rule** panel will appear.\n3. Select the desired **Redirect type**:  \n    a. **Ends with**: To set the redirection rule for an article with the unique slug at the end of your URL.   \n    b. **Replace with**: To set the redirection rule for the URL text between the domain name and the article slug.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Article_Redirect_rule_Overview_page.png)\n\n#### Ends with\n\n4. In the **Source path** field, type the unique slug at the end of your URL for the redirect.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The URL slug in the source path must start with a **forward slash** (`/`).\n\n5. In the **Destination URL** field, type the full destination URL or type the new slug for redirection. Adding a forward slash (**/**) at the beginning of the destination URL is optional.\n\n> **Example**: To redirect the article URL from `https://docs.document360.com/docs/getting-started-with-document360` to `https://docs.document360.com/docs/getting-started-video-library`, add the source path and destination URL as mentioned below:  \n> **Source path**: `/getting-started-with-document360`  \n> **Destination URL:** `getting-started-video-library`\n\n6. Click **Create**.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot-Ends_with_redirection_rule.png)\n\n#### Replace with\n\n7. In the **Source path** field, type the text between the domain and the article slug that you want to redirect.\n\n> **Example**: The source path in the URL `https://project.technicaldocumentation.com/v1/docs/fr/getting-started` is `/v1/docs/fr/`.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The source path must start and end with a **forward slash** (`/`).\n\n8. In the **Replace text** field, type the new URL text you want to use for redirection.\n\n> **Example:** Replace `/v1/docs/fr/` with `/v2/docs/en/` in the URL `https://project.technicaldocumentation.com/v1/docs/fr/getting-started`.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The replace text must start and end with a **forward slash** (`/`).\n\n9. Click **Create**.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/3_Screenshot-Replace_with_redirection_rule.png)\n\n---\n\n### Best practices\n\nIf you manage a multilingual Knowledge base with multiple project workspaces, set redirect rules based on language or workspace. For instance, if you set a rule with the source path `/customer-support` and the destination `/sales-and-support`, this applies only to the default language of the main workspace.\n\n* To apply this rule to another language (e.g., German: `/de/`), create a new rule with the source path `/de/customer-support` and the destination `/de/sales-and-support`.\n* To apply the rule in another workspace (e.g., version 1: `/v1/`), set the source path `/v1/docs/customer-support` and the destination `/v1/docs/sales-and-support`.\n\n---\n\n### Site-level redirect rule\n\nIn the **Article redirect rules** page, you can set a subfolder redirect rule at the site level using the **Replace with** option. This is useful for migrating from another platform or redirecting deprecated workspaces/languages.\n\n> Example: Set a redirect rule for the subfolder `/azure/serverless` to `/data/cloud360` in the URLs like `https://apidocs.serverless360.com/azure/serverless/article_slug`.\n\n---",
    "summary": "## Adding an article redirect rule\n\n**TLDR**:\n- To add an article redirect rule, go to the \"Article redirect rules\" page in the Knowledge base portal\n- You can choose between two redirect types: \"Ends with\" (for redirecting the unique slug at the end of the URL) or \"Replace with\" (for redirecting the text between the domain and the slug)\n- For \"Ends with\", specify the source path (unique slug) and the destination URL\n- For \"Replace with\", specify the source path (text between domain and slug) and the new replace text\n- Best practices include setting up redirect rules based on language or workspace, and creating a site-level redirect rule for migrating from another platform or redirecting deprecated workspaces/languages"

They typically result in a 404 error page.a\n\n#### **What is an article slug?**\n\nA slug is the part of a URL that uniquely identifies a specific article/page. It comes after the `/` in your project's root URL.\n\n> **Example**:  \n> **Article URL**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/why-did-we-build-document360`\n>\n> **Slug**: `/why-did-we-build-document360`\n\n#### **How many redirect rules can I set up in a project?**\n\nYou can set up a maximum of 10,000 redirect rules per project. If you exceed the limit, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@document360.com).\n\n#### **Are there limits for the import redirect rules feature?**\n\nYou can import up to 1,000 redirect rules per day and use the import feature up to five times per day. If you exceed the limit, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@document360.com).\n\n#### **Why is my published article redirecting to another article or leading to a 404 error on the Knowledge base site?**\n\nThis issue may occur due to a **redirection rule** applied to the article's link. A redirection rule can redirect the article to another page or cause a 404 error if it is misconfigured.\n\nTo resolve this:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** ()> **Knowledge base site** > **Article** **redirect** **rules** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Search for the article's slug in the search bar to check for any redirection rules.\n3. If a rule is applied, validate its purpose. If the rule is unnecessary or misconfigured, remove it.\n4. Save the changes and revisit the article to ensure it displays as expected on the Knowledge base site.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n#### **Why do I see the error \"The KB site is redirected too many times when accessed?\"**\n\nThis error occurs due to a redirect loop, often caused by setting the Document360 Knowledge base site URL as the Sign-in URL for JWT authentication. Ensure the Sign-in URL for JWT authentication is not the same as the Document360 KB site URL. Use a dedicated authentication page as the Sign-in URL to avoid redirect loops and resolve the error.\n\n#### **How can we address the issue of 404 errors when we discontinue functionalities that lead to incoming links from sources we cannot control?**\n\nFor discontinued features, to manage 404 errors effectively, create a standard article informing users about the discontinuation of a functionality, which can be used to redirect relevant articles.\n\nFor multiple discontinued functionalities, consider establishing a centralized page that consolidates all related information, ensuring users can easily access updates and reducing the occurrence of dead links.\n\n#### **How do I redirect an article from one page to another using Custom JavaScript?**\n\nTo redirect an article from one page to another using Custom JavaScript, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Click **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.\n3. Paste the following code in the **JavaScript** tab:\n\n   ```\n   $(document).ready(function() {\n     if(window.location.href==\"source URL\") {\n       window.location.replace(\"destination URL\");\n     }\n   });\n\n   ```\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   Copy\n4. Replace the **source URL** and **destination URL** in the code.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n#### **Why do I see the error \"Failed to save article redirection rule” while saving a new article redirect?**\n\nThis error occurs when you try to use a destination slug (the target URL path for a redirection) as the source path for another redirection. Once a destination is defined in a redirection rule, it becomes a static target and cannot be reused as a source in a new rule.   \nTo avoid this error, ensure that the destination slug is not used as a source path in any existing or new redirection rules.\n\n#### **How do I write a redirection rule to replace the workspace name in the URL?**\n\nYou can use redirection rules when migrating from a different platform to Document360.\n\n* Old URL structure: `https://docs.document360.com/{oldworkspace}/section/page`\n* New URL structure: `https://docs.document360.com/{newworkspace}/section/page`\n\nThe same domain must be mapped to both platforms for the redirection to work. For example,   \nIf the old workspace is v1 and the new workspace is v2:\n\n| Source | Destination | Rule |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `/v1` | `/` | endswith |\n| `/v1/` | `/v2` | replacewith |\n\nThis rule ensures that all requests pointing to the old workspace v1 are redirected to the new workspace v2.\n\n#### **How can I redirect a specific article/category URL to the homepage of** **my documentation?**\n\nTo redirect a specific URL to the homepage of my documentation, change the destination URL as ‘**/**’.  \nFor example, if you wish to redirect the URL `https://docs.radixdlt.com/docs/welcome` to `https://docs.radixdlt.com` , set the source URL as /docs/welcome and destination URL as ‘**/**’ in the replace with redirection rule.\n\n<a id=\"configuring-the-article-settings\"></a>",

    "text": "## Best practices\n\nHere at **Kovai.co**, we believe that best practices create secure and robust applications. We recommend that Document360 users follow our list of best practices to prevent unexpected data loss or unauthorized access.\n\n### List of best practices:\n\n1. **We do not recommend publicly sharing the API key via less-secured networks,** as it can result in unauthorized data access. The key can be used to view or exploit your data. In such a case, we recommend deleting the key immediately and creating a new API key for your usage.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/creating-document360-api-tokens).\n\n2. **We recommend giving** **an API key only the required permissions**, as this helps keep the data in safe hands and prevents unauthorized users from modifying it. For example, to view an *\"example\"* set of data, the API key only needs the GET method. This does not let users modify the data using the API key.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/creating-document360-api-tokens).\n\n3. **We suggest that the team manager give each user the correct access rights,** as most of our customers have a team that has access rights to the documentation. We simplify this by having roles corresponding to a certain access rights level.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/team-roles-and-permissions-explained).\n\n4. **We recommend that** **users take advantage of the backup functionalities**. The project will be automatically backed up every day at 00:00 UTC. You can also manually back up your project anytime to keep the changes made safe.  Both of these will back up the Settings, Landing Page, Documentation, and Entire Project contents and can be restored at any time to return to a previous version. This process is made available to keep the users in control and to prevent data loss.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/backup-restore).\n\n5. **We recommend you use the option to make the document private if needed**. Various customers have different use cases for our product. You might want the documentation to be visible to the public or internal team members. The project owners can make the documentation private in the latter case and make it not visible to the public.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/making-a-knowledge-base-private).\n\n---",

If you navigate to ****Drive**()** and then return to ****Analytics**()**, your custom date range filter remains applied, ensuring the data view remains relevant.\n2. **Category manager**   \n   Users often expand the category to view subcategories and articles. Remember state retains the category manager’s last position, making it easier to pick up where you left off.\n\n   **Example:** While exploring subcategories in ****Documentation**()**, you expand a category and navigate to ****Analytics**()**. When you return to ****Documentation**()**, the category manager remains expanded in the same position, maintaining your navigation context.\n3. **Workspace dropdown**  \n   For team members working across multiple workspaces, Remember state preserves the selected workspace even when navigating through other sections.\n\n   **Example:** Suppose you are in ****Analytics**()** under the Beta workspace. You switch to workspace V1, explore the ****Drive**()** section, and then return to ****Analytics**()**. With Remember state enabled, you’ll land back in ****Analytics**()** under workspace V1, maintaining your workspace continuity.\n\n<a id=\"team-auditing\"></a>",

Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base portal** > **Team auditing** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   By default, **Team auditing** tab will be selected.\n2. In the **Activity by user** dropdown, select the desired team account and click **Apply**.\n3. In the **Event** dropdown, choose the required events and click **Apply**.\n4. In the **Audit date** dropdown, choose the date range.\n\n   The audit data for the selected team account will be listed.\n5. Click **Export CSV** to download the data as a CSV file.\n\n**How frequently is the audit data updated?**\n\nAudit data is updated in real-time. You can click the Refresh button to ensure you are viewing the latest activities.\n\n**Can I view actions performed by specific team accounts?**\n\nYes, you can filter the audit data to view actions performed by specific team accounts.\n\n**Can I restrict access to team auditing data for certain team members?**\n\nYes, access to team auditing can be restricted based on user roles and permissions within the Document360 project.\n\n**Can I recover deleted articles or content through team auditing?**\n\nTeam auditing only tracks actions taken, it does not provide recovery options. To recover deleted content, refer to the Document360 [backup and restore](/help/docs/backup-restore) or [version history](/help/docs/revision-history) features.\n\n**Can I monitor specific events instead of all project-related events?**\n\nYes, turn on the toggle for specific event categories to monitor only those events.\n\n**Can I track changes made to the knowledge base site settings?**\n\nYes, you can monitor site-specific activities like custom CSS updates, enabling cookie consent, etc.\n\n**Is it possible to track actions related to Drive activities?**\n\nYes, you can monitor Drive-related activities such as folder additions, deletions, and file updates.\n\n**Why is the article creation event missing or showing the old name in Team auditing after a Word import?**\n\nIf the article name is manually updated during the Word import process, this change will not be captured in the Team auditing, and the original name of the Word file will be reflected. To ensure the correct article name is reflected in auditing logs, avoid renaming the article during the import process. Instead, rename it after the import is complete.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n<a id=\"localization-getting-started\"></a>",
    "summary": "## Setting up the audit configuration\n\n**TLDR:**\n- Enable the \"All events\" toggle to monitor all project-related activities, or selectively enable event categories like documentation editor, drive, knowledge base portal settings, knowledge base site settings, knowledge base widget settings, users & security settings, and tools settings.\n- You can filter audit data by user, event type, and date range, and export the data as a CSV file.\n- The audit data is updated in real-time and can be used to track changes made by team members, but cannot be used to recover deleted content.\n- Access to the team auditing feature"

    "text": "## Localization - Getting started\n\n**Plans supporting localization settings in Knowledge base portal**\n\n| Professional | Business | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nLocalization is the process of transforming and translating the content, look, and feel of a product or service to a specific market or locale. In most cases, the audience is classified based on language, region, or more. In reality, localization is a business's key to unlocking an entirely new revenue center and widening its brand reach in the global market.\n\n---\n\nHaving a global clientele for your business necessitates having a localized language website and knowledge base. This would eliminate many obstacles that your customers encounter when interacting with a single-language website for support.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> * Localization will be available in all plans. You can also purchase additional languages localization as an add-on.\n> * In Document360, if you have a default language of your knowledge base as English, you can also add support articles in a few other languages, like Spanish and Japanese.\n> * The reader would choose to switch between the different languages using a dropdown at the top right section of your page.\n> * If you have translated the articles in the respective languages by manual or machine translation, upon selection, the support articles will be displayed in the chosen languages.\n\n### Complete localization\n\nA localized Document360 knowledge base would  constitute the respective language's specific functionalities, articles, and controls. This involves translating the content from the original language and modifying it to better suit the target audience. In addition, the graphics, color, aesthetics, fonts, and images can be customized accordingly.\n\nApart from the content and visual elements, there are other parameters like units of measure, currencies, local formats for addresses, dates, communication addresses, and more.\n\nA fully localized knowledge base resonates with your diverse users by incorporating culturally relevant nuances, making it feel familiar instead of simply using machine translators and replacing the English words with translated text.\n\nA multilingual Document360 knowledge base could automatically detect and load in a customer's preferred language (based on the customer's login location or browser location preferences).\n\n### FAQ(s)\n\n**What is the localization of a knowledge base?**\n\nLocalization of a knowledge base refers to the process of adapting and translating content in your product's documentation to suit the language, culture, and preferences of different target audiences in various regions.\n\n**Why is it important to localize our product's knowledge base?**\n\nLocalizing your knowledge base enhances the user experience by providing content in the user's native language, making it easier for them to understand and use your product. It also demonstrates your commitment to serving a global customer base and reducing the churn rate.\n\n**What content should be localized in a knowledge base?**\n\nTypically, all customer-facing content, including articles, FAQs, user guides, smart bars, cookie consent, controls, and interface text, should be localized to ensure consistency and clarity for users in different regions.\n\n**How do I decide which languages to prioritize for localization?**\n\nDocument360 recommends you prioritize languages based on your customer demographics, market demand, and potential growth opportunities in specific regions. Analyze your customer's data and feedback to make informed decisions.\n\n**Can I use machine translation for knowledge base localization?**\n\nWhile the machine translation tools offered by Document360 can be a starting point, it's recommended to have human translators review and refine the content to ensure accuracy and maintain the intended meaning.\n\n**How do I maintain consistency across localized knowledge base content?**\n\nDocument360 recommends the implementation of style guides, glossaries, and translation memory to maintain consistent terminology and writing conventions across different languages.\n\n**What challenges should I anticipate during knowledge base localization?**\n\nSome challenges include cultural nuances, technical jargon, and context-specific references that may not directly translate. A well-planned localization strategy can help overcome these challenges. You can also use third-party translation integration, such as Crowdin, with your Document360 project.\n\n> For more information, read the article on [Crowdin integrating with Document360](/help/docs/crowdin).\n\n**How often should I update the localized knowledge base content?**\n\nDocument360 recommends you keep localized content up-to-date with the original source content. Regularly review and update translated articles to reflect changes and improvements. Use the \"**Review reminder**\" feature to set up regular notifications.\n\n**Should I use separate knowledge base workspaces for each language or have a single multilingual knowledge base workspace?**\n\nThis depends on your resources and user needs. Document360 recommends the use of a single multilingual knowledge base workspace. It is more manageable, and Document360 offers an array of security and access features for better control and customization.\n\n**How do I measure the success of my knowledge base localization efforts?**\n\nUse metrics like user engagement, performance analytics, geography metrics, support ticket reduction, customer satisfaction, and feedback from users in different regions to evaluate the effectiveness of your knowledge base localization strategy.\n\n<a id=\"setting-up-a-multi-lingual-knowledge-base\"></a>",
    "summary": "## Localization - Getting started\n\n**TLDR:** Document360 knowledge bases can be localized into multiple languages, adjusting content and visual elements for various cultures.  This service is available across all plans.  Translations can leverage machine translation tools, but human review is recommended for accuracy.  Style guides, glossaries, and translation memory enhance consistency.  User engagement, support tickets, and customer feedback are localization success metrics.  Language selection is prioritized based on customer demographics and market demand."

This makes it easier for users to find the information they need.\n* **Better Organization**: You can segment your knowledge base into well-defined areas, making it easier for team members to manage and update content.\n* **Team Collaboration**: With workspaces, your team can collaborate more effectively, assigning peer reviews, tracking updates, and providing feedback within designated areas.\n\n---",

Instead of purchasing separate Document360 projects for each product, you could create a workspace for each product within a single project. This allows you to manage all documentation in one place, but with clear boundaries for each product’s knowledge base.\n\n### Use case 2: Audience-specific documentation\n\nConsider a SaaS product that has different documentation needs for developers, end-users, and administrators. By setting up separate workspaces for each audience, you can ensure that each group accesses content relevant to their role, avoiding confusion and unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Use case 3: Internal and external knowledge bases\n\nIf you’re creating both internal documentation (for your support or development teams) and external documentation (for customers), multiple workspaces make it easy to keep each set of content separate. This structure allows you to control access permissions, ensuring that only designated users can view internal documents while keeping customer-facing content public.\n\n---",

    "text": "## Email domain\n\n**Plans supporting access to email domain settings in the knowledge base portal**\n\n| Professional | Business | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nConfiguring a custom email domain in Document360 allows your organization to send notifications from a branded email address, improving recognition and trust among your readers while reinforcing your branding strategy.\n\nBy default, notification emails are sent from `support@document360.com` to team accounts and readers. To make customer notifications more personalized, you can set up emails to be sent from an address like `support@yourcompany.com`, making it easier for recipients to identify and trust the sender.\n\nTo enable this feature, you’ll need to configure your DNS entries with your provider to point to Document360.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Ensure you have access to a DNS provider such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in), [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.in), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), etc.\n* This custom email domain feature is available only in the **Enterprise plan**.\n\n---\n\n### Configuring a Custom Email domain\n\nTo configure a custom email domain, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base portal** > **Notifications** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   By default, the **Notification channels** tab will be selected.\n2. Select the **Email Domain** tab.\n3. In the **Domain name** field, enter your custom email domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).\n4. Click **Add Domain**. This will generate the DNS records needed for configuration.\n\n**Adding DNS records**\n\n5. Open your DNS provider’s website in a separate tab to add the required MX and TXT records.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Ensure you add the DNS records provided by Document360 to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Hostinger). Adding these records will not override existing MX records.\n\n6. Copy the configuration details from the **Setting up your custom email domain** section in Document360 and paste them into your DNS provider’s settings.\n7. Return to the **Email domain** page in Document360.\n8. Select the **I’ve added the records** checkbox, then click **Verify & Save**.\n\n   Once the MX and TXT records are verified, an **Email Domain Verified** message will appear.\n9. After verification, enter your custom sender information:\n\n   1. **Email field:** Enter the desired “From” email address (e.g., `support@yourcompany.com`).\n   2. **Name field:** Enter the sender name (e.g., `Your Company Support`).\n\nAfter setup, emails will be sent from the configured domain with the specified “From” email address and sender name.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Email_domain.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your custom email domain configuration is still inactive after 24 hours, try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that the MX and TXT records were saved on the domain host.\n2. Ensure the MX and TXT information on the domain host matches the records provided by Document360.\n3. If issues persist, delete the records on the domain host and re-add them.\n\nFor further assistance, please contact us at `support@document360.com`.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**What is the purpose of MX records, and how do they work?**\n\nMX (Mail Exchange) records are DNS entries that route emails sent to your domain to the correct mail servers. They define the mail servers responsible for handling your email and their priority order. For example, if one mail server is unavailable, emails are sent to the next server in line based on priority (a lower number indicates higher priority).\n\n**Example:**  \nIf your domain has the following MX records:\n\n* `10 mail1.example.com`\n* `20 mail2.example.com`\n\nEmails are routed first to `mail1.example.com` and then to `mail2.example.com` if the primary server is down.\n\n**How are TXT records used in email authentication?**\n\nTXT (Text) records are DNS entries that store text-based information linked to a domain. They serve multiple purposes, such as verifying domain ownership, setting up email security policies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, and providing general domain-related information.\n\nExample: **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework), a TXT record specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain, helping to prevent spoofing.\n\n**SPF Example Record:** `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`\n\nBy implementing TXT records, you can protect your domain from phishing, spoofing, and unauthorized email usage.\n\n<a id=\"how-to-use-postman\"></a>",
