2. **Configure web.config**:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
<system.webServer>
   <rewrite>
      <rules>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_HomePage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help$" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/v1" />
               <serverVariables>
                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_DocsPage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help/(.*)" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/help/{R:1}" />

                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
      </rules>
   </rewrite>
</system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

**Important**: Backup `web.config` before changes. Define both subfolder and API paths for KB Site 2.0.

### Plan Availability

Available for Business and Enterprise plans when site access is Private or Mixed.

### Configuring Reader Self-Registration

Enable in Document360 settings:

- Assign reader groups to domains
- Domain-specific settings override defaults

### Creating Reviewer Accounts

Create individually or via CSV bulk import:
- Select "Reviewer" role during creation

**No default reader group selected**: Readers get unrestricted access.

**Multiple group memberships**: Readers receive highest access level per content item.

**Individual vs. group access**: Highest privilege from both granted.

**Access prioritization**: Highest privilege at each content level determines access.

**Self-registration not working with SSO**: Requires Document360 login page (bypassed by SSO).

## Access Control

### Blocking Inheritance

Override inherited content access permissions for granular control. Restrict access to specific content (workspaces, languages, categories, articles) regardless of broader team permissions.

Administrators grant access to targeted accounts per content level. Removing inherited permissions isolates access to explicitly added accounts.

### Block Inheritance FAQs

Disabling inheritance restricts access to specified team accounts/groups. Account performing action is automatically selected and cannot be removed.

### Enabling Inheritance

1. Navigate to category/article in Documentation
2. Access Security settings via More icon
3. Toggle off **Block inherited account**
4. Confirm with **Yes**
5. Close blade

Allows inherited team accounts/groups to access content.

## Security

### IP Restriction

Control knowledge base access by allowing/blocking specific IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). Applies to all workspaces and languages within project.

### Managing IP Restrictions

1. Navigate to **Settings > User & Security > IP Restriction**
2. View IP details: name, address, Allow/Block status
3. Add IP: enter name, IP or range, save
4. Set permissions: Allow or Block
5. Remove IPs using delete icon

### IP Restriction FAQs

**IP address**: Identifying number for internet communication.

**IPv4 format**: Four numbers (0-255) separated by dots (e.g., 49.206.113.170).

**IPv6 format**: Eight hexadecimal groups separated by colons.

**IPv6 unicast address**: Identifies single interface for direct communication.

## Authentication

### Understanding SSO

Access multiple applications with single login. Users authenticate once via central service provider.

### Benefits of SSO

- Enhanced security: fewer credential storage points
- Increased productivity: faster access, fewer passwords
- Improved UX: fewer login prompts
- Simplified IT: centralized credential management
- Compliance support: meets industry mandates
- Cost reduction: less redundant systems/support

### SSO Process

Collaboration between Service Provider (Document360) and Identity Provider (IdP):
1. User accesses Service Provider
2. Redirected to IdP for authentication
3. IdP issues Access/ID token
4. Service Provider validates token
5. User accesses applications without additional sign-ins

Supports multiple IdPs.

### Identity Providers

External entity managing user identities for SSO. Stores credentials, handles logins for applications.

Examples: Okta, Entra ID, Google, ADFS, OneLogin

### Logging In with SSO

1. Navigate to Knowledge base portal
2. Enter email or subdomain
3. Click "Continue with SSO"
4. Authenticate via IdP

### IdP-Initiated Sign-In

Login directly from IdP dashboard if configured. Find Document360 app in IdP dashboard to initiate SSO login.

### Supported SSO Standards

SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect:
- SAML 2.0: secure cross-application authentication
- OpenID Connect: modern, user-friendly alternative
- Both support various IdPs with comprehensive setup guides

### SSO Login - Portal

Access Knowledge base portal using IdP credentials. Eliminates need for multiple passwords.

### SSO Login - Site

Knowledge base site supports SSO login with existing IdP credentials.

### SSO Login Process

1. Visit site
2. Select IdP login button
3. Log into IdP
4. Automatically logged in

Login buttons vary by configuration.

### Troubleshooting SSO Login

HTTP 500 error likely from:
- Outdated SAML certificate
- Incorrect attribute mappings

Solutions:
- Update IdP with latest Document360 metadata
- Verify SAML attributes match exactly

Contact support if issues persist.

### Adding SSO Team Accounts

Standard team account creation + additional steps:
1. Ensure user email matches SSO domain
2. Select SSO configuration
3. Optionally skip invitation email

Only Owners/Admins can add accounts.

### Enabling IdP-Initiated Sign-In

Enable during SSO setup:
1. Toggle **Allow IdP initiated Sign-In** ON
2. Find Document360 application in IdP dashboard
3. Click to initiate login
4. Access Knowledge base with SSO credentials

### Inviting SSO Users

After SAML/OpenID configuration, users authenticate via:
- Okta
- Azure AD
- Google Workspace

Add users directly or invite existing users.

### Deleting SSO Users

1. Navigate to Team accounts & groups
2. Hover over SSO account
3. Click "Delete"
4. Confirm

SSO users identified by SSO label. Deletes SSO account, not associated team account.

### SSO FAQs

Can't add user twice as SSO reader. If exists, "Create reader account" button disabled. SAML used for SSO.

### Inviting Existing Users to SSO

1. Log in to Document360
2. Navigate to **Settings > Users & Security > SAML/OpenID**
3. Edit SSO configuration
4. Select **All users** or **Selected users only**
5. Save

Users receive invitation email. Additional SSO account created alongside existing one.

### Mapping SSO Configurations

Map existing SAML/OpenID configuration to another project:
1. Log in
2. Navigate to project settings
3. Select "Create SSO"
4. Choose existing configuration from dropdown

Existing IdP and protocol must match.

### Disabling the Default Login Page
