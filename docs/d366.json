The `Content-Security-Policy` header controls allowed domains for each resource type (e.g., CSS, scripts, frames). Different tiers (Professional, Business, Enterprise) may have varying implementation levels of CSP.\n\n### Security: Enabling CSP\n\nEnable Content Security Policy (CSP) in your Knowledge Base to prevent XSS attacks. Specify allowed domains for stylesheets, JavaScript, and frames in the portal's security settings. Use correct URL format (e.g., `https://example.com`) and commas to separate entries. Add nonce attributes to custom HTML scripts.\n\n### Security: Configuring X-Frame Options\n\nEnable X-Frame options to prevent your knowledge base from being embedded in iframes, frames, or other tags on external domains. Navigate to **Settings > Users & Security > Security** and toggle on the **Enable X-Frame options** setting to block unauthorized embedding. This helps protect against clickjacking attacks. If needed, specific domains can be allowed via the content security policy. Not enabling this feature risks embedding on malicious sites, exposing users to security threats like clickjacking.\n\n### Security: Testing CSP Settings\n\nDocument360's CSP is implemented via meta elements, not response headers. To verify CSP, check the page source for `Content-Security-Policy`. Video playback issues often indicate differing CSP settings across articles; ensure the video source is allowed in the correct Frame sources in Document360 settings.\n\n### Security: Bot Management\n\nBots are internet software programs that can be helpful or harmful. The table showing plans with bot management capabilities is empty.\n\n### Security: Troubleshooting CSP\n\nBlocked content on the Knowledge Base site is often due to incorrect CSP configurations. To resolve, update Knowledge Base portal CSP settings to whitelist affected domain URLs. Clear your browser cache, test in different environments/browsers. If the problem continues, contact support providing CSP response header details from browser developer tools' Network tab. Also, ensure application's CSP settings for the knowledge base widget are correct.\n\n### Security: Understanding Bot Management\n\nBot management is crucial for online safety & efficiency. It filters malicious bots, allowing legitimate access, preventing server strain, and stopping potential threats. Key focus is identifying and blocking bad bots, while letting good bots operate.\n\n### Security: CSP and Whitelisting for Widgets\n\nThis document provides guidelines for implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) and whitelisting for the Document360 widget. Key points include:\n\n- **supported plans**: Only Enterprise plans support widget addition.\n- **CSP Directives**: Add trusted sources to `connect-src`, `script-src-elem`, `font-src`, and `style-src-elem` directives for both US and EU users.\n- **US Sources**:\n- `connect-src`: Includes Algolia, Document360 APIs, and Azure Monitor domains.\n- `script-src-elem`: Includes CDN resources and nonce for script security.\n- `font-src`: Includes Google Fonts and Document360 CDN.\n- `style-src-elem`: Allows inline styles, CDN resources, and Google Fonts.\n- **EU Sources**:\n- Similar to US sources but with EU-specific Document360 domains.\n- **Widget Configuration**:\n- Update the widget JavaScript with the correct nonce value and API key.\n\n### Security: Bot Detection Methods\n\nCloudflare uses heuristics (rules based on patterns) and machine learning to analyze traffic and user-agent data, proactively identifying and blocking malicious bots, thus strengthening security against sophisticated attacks.\n\n### Security: Bot Blocking Techniques\n\nCloudflare blocks bots using unusual user agents, unsupported ports, and suspicious IP/ISP traffic patterns. This protects against attacks but may affect automated scripts. Essential security measures to protect platforms.\n\n### Security: Bot Categorization\n\nBots are categorized into Good Bots and Bad Bots. Good Bots, such as GoogleBot, BingBot, and GPTBot, are transparent and serve beneficial purposes. Bad Bots, including those used in DDoS attacks, web scraping, and credential stuffing, engage in malicious activities.\n\nDocument360 offers enhanced security with built-in bot detection and blocking in Block mode, proactively preventing unwanted traffic to safeguard data integrity.",
    "summary": "## Security\n\nDocument360 offers robust security measures through Content Security Policy (CSP) and bot management. CSP restricts external resources to prevent XSS attacks, configurable by specifying allowed domains for stylesheets, scripts, and frames, with nonce attributes for custom scripts. X-Frame options prevent unauthorized embedding, protecting against clickjacking. Bot management leverages Cloudflare's heuristics and machine learning to detect and block malicious bots, categorizing them into good (e.g., GoogleBot) and bad (e.g., DDoS bots). Enhanced features include widget security for Enterprise plans with specific CSP directives and troubleshooting guidance for resolving blocked content. Regular updates and proper configurations ensure data integrity and protection against sophisticated threats."

    "heading": "Content Organization",
    "text": "## Content Organization\n\n### Content Organization: Categories and Subcategories\n\nDocument360 categories and subcategories are organizational tools that structure articles into logical groups, improving user navigation and accessibility. Categories represent broad topics, while subcategories provide more specific divisions. They can be customized, including renaming and changing icons, and articles can be assigned to multiple categories. Best practices include clear naming, logical hierarchy, and user-centric organization. Access permissions can be applied, and categories can be reordered. Visibility issues may arise if articles are unpublished or absent; troubleshooting includes checking browser settings and cache. Proper structuring enhances knowledge base usability and user experience.\n\n### Content Organization: Creating a Category\n\nDocument360 allows category creation via four methods: top-bar \"Create\", \"Flywheel\", \"More\" icon, and within a Folder/Index. Fill in name, nesting level, and type (Folder, Index, Page, or GitHub), then click \"Create\". Favor a maximum of 3 subcategory levels for optimal navigation. Alternative content finding tools include tags, search, and related articles.\n\n### Content Organization: Changing Category Icons\n\nTo customize category icons in a knowledge base, navigate to the Documentation section, select the desired folder/index category, search for/browse emojis, choose one, and confirm. Emoji selection isn't possible for \"Page\" type categories.\n\n### Content Organization: Managing Categories\n\n- Document360 supports category management across Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans.\n- Key features: create, rename, delete, move, clone, reorder, star categories, customize icons.\n- Benefits: well-organized, accessible knowledge base for teams and users.\n\n### Content Organization: Hiding and Unhiding Categories\n\nDocument360 allows restricting team access to categories and subcategories within documentation. Hidden items are marked, and users can hide/unhide using the \"More\" menu in categories/folders/index. Hiding one category hides everything under it. Four methods are described for hiding/unhiding in various contexts (single items, groups, folders, etc.), through the navigation menus and visual aids.\n\n### Content Organization: Renaming a Category\n\nDocument360 allows renaming categories within the knowledge base via two methods: directly on the category page or via the \"More\" menu. This action doesn't change the category's URL slug; simply update the displayed name.\n\n### Content Organization: Deleting a Category\n\nThere are four methods to delete categories in the Knowledge base portal:\n\n1. **Categories & Articles section**: Hover over the category, click **More** > **Delete**, then confirm.\n2. **Folder/Index category**: In the desired category, click **More** > **Delete**, then confirm.\n3. **Multiple articles/subcategories**: Select checkboxes, click **Delete**, confirm.\n4. **Specific article/subcategory**: Hover, click **More** > **Delete**, confirm.\n\n**Note**: Deleting a root category removes all subcategories and articles, stored in the recycle bin for 30 days.\n\n### Content Organization: Cloning a Category\n\nClone categories in Document360 by selecting the \"More\" then \"Clone\" option on your target category or item within a category. Choose target workspace/category, optionally update linked files automatically. Security restrictions apply depending on destination. Three methods are available: in the main category list, within a folder/index, or on a specific article/subcategory in a folder/index.\n\n### Content Organization: Understanding Category Types\n\nCategories and subcategories in Document360 serve as organizational tools to group similar articles, resembling folders for related content. The document references a comparison table for Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans, though specific details in the table are unspecified.\n\n### Content Organization: Starring a Category\n\nTo star a category for quick access, go to the Documentation section, select the category, and click the Star icon. You can also star subcategories and articles. To unstar, either click the Star icon again or remove them from the Starred section by selecting checkboxes and clicking \"Remove from starred.\" The Starred section acts like a favorites list, enhancing navigation efficiency.\n\n### Content Organization: Moving a Category\n\nYou can move a category or subcategory across workspaces using 5 methods:\n\n1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag the category within the same workspace.\n2. **More Icon in Categories & Articles**: Use the More icon to access the Move option and select a destination.\n3. **More Icon in Folder/Index**: Similar to Method 2 but initiated from within a specific folder.\n4. **Move Multiple Items**: Select multiple articles/subcategories and use the Move icon.\n5. **Move Specific Item**: Use the More icon on a specific item within a folder.\n\n**Key Considerations**: Moving affects all subcategories/articles; cannot move root categories into subcategories; link updating is recommended when moving across workspaces.\n\n### Content Organization: Drive Folder Mapping\n\n**Drive folder mapping** automatically places images uploaded by contributors to articles into specific Drive folders based on the article's category and subcategory.\n\n### Content Organization: Types of Categories\n\nThree category types for organizing a Document360 knowledge base: **Folder** (container for articles/subcategories, no URL), **Index** (generates a URL, lists articles with details), and **Page** (functions like an article with content creation). Categories can be switched anytime without data loss.\n\n### Content Organization: Linking Drive Folders\n\nTo link a Drive folder to a Document360 category, navigate to the category, click \"More\" (•••), \"Set drive folder,\" select the desired folder, and click \"Update.\" Subcategory mappings take precedence over parent mappings for image uploads. Changes only affect new images.\n\n### Content Organization: Category-Drive Mapping\n\nImplement a system to map categories to Google Drive folders by setting up categories as metadata or labels, and use the Drive API or scripts (for Business/Enterprise) to automate file organization into corresponding folders. Enterprise versions likely offer enhanced automation and management features.",
    "summary": "## Content Organization\n\nDocument360's content organization system uses categories and subcategories for logical grouping of articles within a knowledge base.  Users can create, rename, delete, move, clone, star, and customize categories.  Integration with Google Drive allows automated image placement based on category.  Methods for various tasks (hiding, renaming, deleting) are clearly outlined, catering to different user needs.  Three category types (Folder, Index, Page) are available, each with distinct functionalities.  Key to the system's operation is a logical, hierarchical structure, and user accessibility considerations for optimal experience and knowledge base usability."

Professional includes basic article handling. Business adds version control and collaboration. Enterprise provides advanced access controls and custom workflows for large organizations.\n\n### Content Management: Locking Articles\n\nArticle locking prevents simultaneous edits, crucial for team collaboration. Auto-unlocks after 15 minutes of inactivity. Manual unlocking is achievable through the portal's \"Lock\" icon. Navigation away from the article also automatically unlocks it.\n\n### Content Management: Creating Article Templates\n\nDocument360 allows users to create, save, and reuse article templates for streamlined content creation. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining consistency, especially for repetitive structures like troubleshooting guides. Articles can be created from templates using three methods: via the Flywheel icon, the More option, or the Create button on the top bar. Each method involves selecting a template and customizing the article name and category. Additional features include automatic population of slugs and accessing template management from the Templates overview page.\n\n### Content Management: Deleting Articles\n\nFive methods for deleting articles in a knowledge base portal are detailed. These include: (1) deleting single articles via the \"More\" icon in \"Categories & Articles\"; (2) deleting articles while in editing mode; (3) bulk deleting articles within \"Folder/Index\" categories; (4) deleting a single article within specific \"Folder/Index\" categories; and (5) bulk deleting across all articles using the \"All articles\" section. Each method involves navigating to the correct location, selecting the article(s), and confirming the deletion. Helpful links are provided to related documentation.\n\n### Content Management: Renaming Articles\n\nTo rename an article, navigate to the article in the Knowledge base portal's Documentation section, click the article name (or hover, click \"More\", select \"Rename\"). Enter the new name and click \"Update\". A confirmation is required if the article is published.\n\n### Content Management: Moving Articles\n\nFive methods exist to move articles in the knowledge base: 1) drag-and-drop categories; 2) using the \"More\" menu; 3/4) moving from folders/index; 5) moving from \"All articles\". Select destination workspace/category and choose whether to update referenced links. Security restrictions apply.\n\n### Content Management: Editing Articles\n\nEditing a published article is crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date content. Here's a concise summary:\n\n- **Publishing Changes**: When an article is published, it becomes live on the Knowledge base site, and its status changes to \"Published\" in the portal.\n- **Editing Process**: To edit, select the article, click the **Edit** button (changing its status to \"Draft\"), make necessary changes, and click **Publish** to update the live version.\n- **Markdown View**: For articles created with Markdown, you can view the formatting by selecting **View markdown** from the **More** menu without creating a new version.\n\nThis process ensures seamless updates and easy access to content formatting.\n\n### Content Management: Replicating Articles\n\nReplicate articles in a knowledge base to multiple categories. Navigate to the article, select \"Replicate,\" choose the target category & click. Source article edits only; replicated article settings may be restricted due to security.\n\n### Content Management: Hiding and Unhiding Articles\n\nIn Document360, users can hide articles to restrict access to team accounts only, indicated by a strikethrough in the Documentation window. This feature is useful for internal content, such as sales team access to pricing details without public visibility.\n\nThere are four methods to hide/unhide articles:\n\n1. **Categories & Articles Section**: Hover over an article, click the More icon, and select Hide/Unhide.\n2. **Folder/Index Category**: Select multiple articles, click Hide/Unhide.\n3. **Specific Article in Folder/Index**: Hover over the article, click More, then Hide/Unhide.\n4. **All Articles Section**: Filter if needed, select multiple articles, and click Hide/Show.\n\nHidden articles are marked with a strikethrough, making them easily identifiable.

    "text": "## Localization\n\n### Localization: Machine Translation Prerequisites\n\nMachine translation requires credits. Check your balance in Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Machine translation. Purchase more if needed. Credits are consumed at a rate of one per translated character.\n\n### Localization: Using Machine Translation\n\nTwo methods for machine translation exist: bulk translation of multiple articles via the \"All articles\" section (involving WYSIWYG editor switch) or for individual articles from within the editor. Both involve setting the translation status. Retranslating is required if the main language article is updated.\n\n### Localization: AI Machine Translation Overview\n\nDocument360's AI machine translation enables seamless localization of content, with benefits including time efficiency, consistency, and scalability. Key points include automatic conversion from Markdown to WYSIWYG and specific behaviors regarding article deletion vs. hiding.\n\nTo customize the Eddy AI, go to **Settings () > AI features > Customization**. On the **Customize Eddy AI** page, you can:\n\n1. **Rename the AI**: Enter a desired name (up to 15 characters) in the **AI assistant name** field.\n2. **Adjust Response Tone**: Choose from options like Default, Professional, Friendly, Casual, or Straightforward to match your preferred style.\n3. **Set Response Length**: Select between Default, Long and detailed, or Short and concise for varying levels of detail.\n\nOnce done, click **Save**. Note: The AI name is subject to moderation checks; override if prompted.\n\n**TL;DR**: Personalize Eddy AI by renaming it, adjusting tone, and response length via the customization page.\n\n### Localization: Translation Status Indicators\n\nMultilingual knowledge base articles have translation status indicators (🌐 for \"Needs translation\") above formatting tools. Filtering by \"Needs translation\" or \"Translated\" in the Knowledge Base portal allows users to locate and update translation status, including machine translation. The main language article doesn't show status.\n\n### Localization: Troubleshooting Machine Translation\n\n- **Large articles:** Split articles exceeding 50,000 characters (HTML) into smaller sections for translation.\n- **Content updates:** Manually trigger updates in secondary languages using the \"Machine translation\" feature in the \"All articles\" section. New content doesn't automatically update.\n- **Supported languages:** Machine translation supports many languages (list provided).\n- **Character limit:** Be mindful of the 50,000 character limit and potential error messages.\n- **Reversibility:** Translating changes the article status, but the original content is not recoverable. Backups are recommended.\n- **Costs:** Machine translation is included in the subscription, but excessive character counts may incur additional charges.\n- **Language management:** Deleting or hiding articles in one language affects the main and other language versions. Changing/Adding languages isn't automatic, requiring specific actions.\n\n### Localization: Machine Translation Examples\n\nDocument360 offers two machine translation methods. **Scenario 1** allows translating existing English articles to other languages (e.g., German, Spanish) via the \"All articles\" section, requiring selection, confirmation, and automated translation. **Scenario 2** involves adding a new language (e.g., French) post-content creation; English articles are replicated but must be translated manually. If languages were added before content creation, manual translation from \"All articles\" is needed. The timing of language addition affects content replication and translation requirements.\n\nTo manage machine translation credits effectively, start by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Machine translation** to monitor your project's usage. The dashboard includes Limit (total credits), Usage (consumed credits), Remaining (leftover credits), and Usage meter (percentage used). Note that individual articles must be under 50,000 characters, including formatting; split larger articles if necessary. Subscription plans determine credit limits: Professional (1M), Business (2M), and Enterprise (5M). Additional credits can be purchased in 1M increments for $50.\n\nMachine translation credits are managed via the settings portal, with metrics for limit, usage, remaining, and usage percentage. Articles must be under 50k characters, including formatting. Subscription tiers set limits (Professional: 1M, Business: 2M, Enterprise: 5M), with options to buy additional 1M credits for $50.",
    "summary": "## Localization\n\n**TLDR:** Document360's machine translation uses credits, with two methods (bulk or individual article). Customize the AI (Eddy) by renaming, adjusting tone, and response length.  Translation status indicators guide users.  Troubleshooting includes splitting large articles, manually updating after content changes, and managing character limits (50,000).  Credits are tied to subscription tiers (Professional: 1M, Business: 2M, Enterprise: 5M) and are purchasable in 1M increments.  Manual translation may be needed for new languages added after content creation.  Delete/hide actions in one language affect all language versions."

Navigate to the desired location, enter the folder name, and click 'Create'. For easier maintenance, align folder structure with knowledge base categories.\n\n### File Management: Understanding System Folders\n\nDocument360 projects include **System folders** like Images, Settings, and Documentation, marked by a shield icon. These folders are essential, restrictions prevent deletion or renaming, but allow actions like adding files, customizing colors, and setting defaults.\n\n### File Management: Adding Files to Drive\n\nAdd files to a drive folder using drag-and-drop (into empty folders) or via the \"More\" menu. Specify file location, optional tags and alt text (for images). Avoid file names with +, %, #, =. Check supported file types.\n\nTo add subfolders, choose between two methods in the Drive section:\n\n1. **Using the 'More' option**:\n\n- Click the More icon next to a folder.\n- Select \"Add folder,\" name it, and set its location.\n\n2. **Using the '+' option**:\n\n- Hover between folders until the '+' icon appears.\n- Click '+,' name the folder, and set its location.\n\nEnsure root folders are expanded to correctly create subfolders. Deleting a root folder also removes its contents.\n\n### File Management: Managing Folders in Drive\n\nOrganize Drive folders and subfolders logically (like your documentation categories) for efficient file storage, maintenance, and retrieval. Document360 allows both individual and bulk folder management. Different service tiers (Professional, Business, Enterprise) are implied but not detailed.\n\n### File Management: Setting Default Folders\n\nSet a default folder for new uploads in a system by selecting it from the Drive. This setting is overridden by existing category-to-folder mappings. Default folders are indicated by an edit icon.\n\n### File Management: File Limits and Restrictions\n\n- **File Limits**: Each folder can hold up to 5000 files, with subfolders treated as separate folders. Single file uploads are capped at **150MB**, while multiple files cannot exceed a combined size of **160MB**.\n- **File Type Restrictions**: Users can restrict allowed file types by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > General > Drive settings**. They must specify media types using the format `media type/extension` and provide lowercase extensions (e.g., .png, .jpg). Multiple types can be added and changes must be saved.\n\n### File Management: Troubleshooting Drive Issues\n\nThe Document360 folder has a 5000-file limit, including direct uploads and images from articles or Docx files. To resolve, use another folder, delete unused files, or clear cache. Alt text for images, limited to 140 characters, aids accessibility. File upload errors may stem from unsupported types, so check settings to ensure allowed media types are selected and avoid special characters in filenames.\n\n### File Management: Starring Folders\n\nTo star a folder in the drive, click the star icon next to it. Starred folders appear in a dedicated \"Starred\" section in the navigation, regardless of their location. Clicking the star again removes it from the starred list.\n\n### File Management: Moving Folders\n\nTo move a folder within the Drive, excluding System folders, use either the **More option** or **drag and drop**:\n\n- **More option method**: Select folder(s), click More > Move, choose destination via search, and confirm.\n- **Drag and drop method**: Drag folder to desired location in left navigation.\n\n### File Management: Renaming Folders\n\nTo rename a folder in Drive, navigate to the desired folder in the tree-view, click the More icon, select Rename, enter the new name, and confirm. Note: System folders cannot be renamed.\n\n### File Management: Changing Folder Colors\n\nChange folder color by hovering over the folder, clicking \"More\", then \"Change Color\". Choose from the color palette, enter a hex code, or use a color picker. Default is gray.\n\n### File Management: Folder Navigation\n\nThe breadcrumb trail in the Drive window shows the folder hierarchy, allowing navigation. Clicking on a level navigates back. Setting a folder as default multiple times has no effect. Renaming, copying, moving, or reordering folders does not change file URLs, keeping related image links intact. Folders act as categories in Document360 for organizing articles.\n\n### File Management: File Actions\n\nFile actions in Google Drive are not detailed in this document. Missing data in the provided table prevents any summary of support plans for specific user groups.\n\n### File Management: Deleting Folders\n\nTo remove or delete a folder, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the Drive icon in the left sidebar.\n2. Use either the More () icon next to the folder or select the folder's checkbox to reveal the Remove option.\n3. Click Remove and then confirm by clicking Yes in the Delete prompt.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n- Deleting a folder breaks media reference links and may take up to a minute to clear the CDN cache.\n- System folders (marked with a shield icon) cannot be deleted.\n- Accidentally deleted folders can be restored from the Recycle bin within 30 days.\n\n### File Management: Troubleshooting File Replacement\n\nDocument360 file replacement error occurs when trying to swap files of different types. Verify file types match, clear browser cache, and test in different browsers. Back up files before replacement as they are permanently overwritten. Contact support if problem persists, providing error screenshots, file details, and a HAR file. No file version history is available.\n\ntag, create a markdown heading called \"Bulk folder actions,\" and provide a concise, entity-dense TLDR of the document. Finally, I need to close the\n\n### File Management: Performing File Actions\n\n- **Navigate to Drive**: Access Drive from the left menu and select the desired folder. Choose between **List view** or **Grid view** to manage files.\n\n- **File Actions**:\n\n- **Move**: Transfer files between folders without changing their links.\n- **Copy**: Duplicate files in another folder.\n- **Add Tags/Alt-text**: Enhance file discoverability by adding tags and alt-text for images.\n- **View Details**: Access file metadata, dependencies, and actions like move, copy, or download.\n- **View Dependencies**: Track how files are linked to articles or other content.\n- **Download**: Export single or multiple files as a .zip.\n- **Remove**: Delete files, moving them to the Recycle Bin.\n- **Replace**: Update a file with a new version without changing its name or URL.\n\n- **Important Notes**:\n- Moving files does not break image links.\n- Deleted files are moved to the Recycle Bin but cannot be restored if overwritten.\n- Use the **Filter** option to identify files with or without dependencies.\n\n### File Management: All Files View\n\nThe All Files overview in Document360 Drive consolidates all project files into a centralized location, enabling efficient bulk operations like moving, copying, or deleting files across multiple folders and subfolders, thus streamlining file management and saving time.\n\n### File Management: Recent, Starred, and Deleted Files\n\nDocument360's Recycle Bin temporarily stores deleted files, folders, categories, and articles. Users can restore deleted content from the Recycle Bin.\n\n### File Management: Managing All Files\n\nThe **All files** page in Document360's Knowledge Base portal displays up to 20 files per page, with options to switch between grid and list views, filter files by criteria like dependencies, upload date, uploader, type, and tags, and view storage usage. Users can perform bulk operations (move, copy, download, remove) on selected files, with pagination for navigating beyond 20 files. Best practices include regular cleanups, using categories for organization, and checking dependencies before deletion.\n\n### File Management: Using the Recycle Bin\n\nRecycle bin allows restoring or permanently deleting Drive files/folders. Restore in bulk or individually. Select items using checkboxes (max 20 with 'Select All'). 'Select all {N} items' for more than 20. Permanently delete individual items or the entire bin. Deletion is irreversible.\n\n### File Management: Viewing Recent Uploads\n\nThe \"Recent\" folder in a Drive window automatically displays the latest uploaded files and folders, simplifying access. Navigate to the Drive icon, then the \"Recent\" folder to view.",
    "summary": "## Bulk Folder Actions\n\nTLDR: Document360 enables efficient bulk folder management through actions like moving, copying, deleting, and adding tags to multiple folders simultaneously. Users can navigate via the Drive section, utilize the All Files view for bulk operations, and leverage the Recycle Bin to restore deleted items. Key features include the ability to view dependencies, ensuring file links remain intact during moves, and enhancing file discoverability with tags and alt-text. Regular audits and dependency checks are recommended to maintain organization and avoid data loss."

AI tool available for tag recommendation.\n\n### Content Organization: Tag FAQs\n\nDocument360 allows multiple tags per article/file for better content grouping and search. Tags improve search results. There's a limit of 1000 tags per project, but no limit on tags per item. Bulk tag import is not currently supported.\n\n### Content Organization: Tag Support by Plan\n\nIn Document360, the Professional plan offers basic tag support, the Business plan provides advanced tag management, and the Enterprise plan includes premium tag features with enhanced customization and analytics.\n\n### Content Organization: Managing Tags - Features\n\nManage project tags by creating, searching, viewing creation info (creator, date), and examining dependencies (Articles, Page category, Files). Edit, move, merge, or remove tag references. Export tags to CSV; filtering available by associations, creation date, and creator. **Cannot delete a tag with dependencies (Articles, Page category, Files).** Remove dependencies first.\n\n### Content Organization: Creating Tags\n\nDocument360 team accounts can use tags to organize articles, pages, and files for better content management and improved search. AI tag recommendations assist in suggesting or creating relevant tags for efficient content classification.\n\n### Content Organization: Managing Tags - Overview\n\nThe **Manage tags** page in Document360 is the central hub for managing tags. It allows assigning tags to articles, category pages, and files, as well as organizing tag groups to consolidate related tags and view their dependencies. Access the page via **Documentation** > **Content tools** > **Documentation** > **Tags**.\n\n### Content Organization: Adding Tags - Methods\n\nFour methods exist to add tags to the knowledge base project: 1) Manage Tags overview page (creating new); 2) Documentation editor; 3) Drive file tagging; 4) All articles page. Each method has specific steps, utilizing a dropdown/search to select or create tags.\n\n### Content Organization: Managing Tags - FAQs\n\n- **Tag Management**: All tag-related actions are managed through the **Manage tags** overview page, accessible under _Content tools_ > _Documentation_ > _Tags_.\n- **Viewing Tags**: The page displays all tags and allows viewing of associated articles or files by clicking on the reference numbers.\n- **Editing Tags**: Users can edit or delete tags directly from the Manage tags page.\n- **Merging Tags**: Similar tags can be merged using the **Merge tags** option.\n- **Managing Dependencies**: Dependencies can be removed individually or in bulk using the **Remove dependencies** option.\n\n### Content Organization: Tag Naming Guidelines\n\nTag names can contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, spaces, and select special characters (\\_ + - @ # % ^ & ! ()). **Forbidden** characters include: \\ / : \\* ? \" < > |.\n\n### Content Organization: Tag Groups Overview\n\nDocument360's tag groups help organize related tags (e.g., articles, page categories, files in Drive), making large tag libraries easier to manage by showing tag relationships and dependencies.\n\n### Content Organization: Tag Limitations\n\nDocument360 tags: Up to 1,000 tags per project. Tag names max 30 characters; descriptions max 100. Descriptions appear as tooltips on hover in the portal/site and below titles on the Tags page.\n\n### Content Organization: Using Tag Groups\n\nTwo ways to add tags to groups: 1) Assign a tag to a group when creating it. 2) Select tags and move them to a group within the tag library.\n\n### Content Organization: Deleting Tag Groups\n\nDeleting a tag group permanently removes the group and all its tags from the project, severing links to associated articles, page categories, and files. Tags cannot be added to articles; tag groups are for organizing tags only.\n\n### Content Organization: Managing Tag Dependencies\n\nTag dependencies allow tracking and managing where tags are applied to various project elements (articles, categories, files) for efficient tag usage and cleanup.\n\n### Content Organization: Creating Tag Groups\n\nTo create a tag group, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to the **Knowledge base portal** and select the **Documentation** tab from the left sidebar.\n2. Navigate to **Content tools > Documentation > Tags**.\n3. Under the **Groups** tab, click **Create group**.\n4.

Analyzing \"no results found\" searches helps identify knowledge base content gaps and optimize the site for user needs. Understanding popular search terms ensures relevant content creation aligning with user queries. \"Bounced search\" refers to searches with no result clicks.\n\n### Analytics: Accessing Reader Analytics\n\nAccess reader analytics from the Knowledge base portal's Analytics > Reader page. Filter by date, reader type (self-registered, SSO, JWT, invited), and knowledge base/widget analytics. Data includes total readers, self-registered readers, frequent readers, and detailed reader information (views, reads, likes, dislikes, articles accessed, last login). View individual reader contributions filtered by date and article. Export data as CSV. Data refresh can take up to 15 minutes.\n\n### Analytics: Accessing Search Analytics\n\n_No summary available for this section._\n\n### Analytics: Reader Analytics Overview\n\nThe Reader analytics tool provides insights into reader activity for Private or Mixed access projects, enabling tracking of user engagement to optimize content strategy.\n\n### Analytics: Team Accounts Analytics\n\nThis page provides detailed analytics on team members' account types, content access/creation, contributions, and last logins.\n\n### Analytics: Accessing Feedback Analytics\n\nAccess Feedback analytics in the Knowledge base portal's Analytics section. Filter data (date, widget type, JWT). Analyze metrics (article feedback, likes, dislikes, comments) via graphs and tables. View specific articles, feedback, and export data as CSV. Important: Only feedback with comments are included. Data refresh can take up to 15 minutes.\n\n### Analytics: Understanding Feedback Analytics\n\nFeedback analytics allows tracking of total comments, likes, and dislikes for articles or pages, with data visualized in charts and graphs. The features are supported across all plans, including Professional, Business, and Enterprise.\n\nThe Team accounts analytics page is accessed via the Knowledge base portal under the Analytics section. Users can filter data by date ranges, with updates taking up to 15 minutes. The page displays metric tiles for total team accounts, articles published, and top performers. Clicking on a team account provides detailed contribution metrics and article performance.

Click **Create**.\n\nThe widget will display the mapped content when the specified URL is accessed, maintaining consistency across tabs within the same version and language.\n\n### Widgets: URL Matching with Regex\n\nThis document explains how to use regular expressions (regex) to match various URL components (protocol, domain, path, query parameters, fragment). Examples show matching specific paths, query parameters, optional parameters, and wildcards. Regex patterns for subdomains and complete URLs are given. Crucially, understanding URL matching is essential for effective URL mapping in web applications, allowing dynamic extraction of information from URLs.\n\n### Widgets: URL Mapping Settings\n\nConfigure URL mapping behavior for unmapped URLs in the Knowledge base widget: Navigate to Widget > Configure & connect, expand URL mapping settings, choose to either display the page help/knowledge base or retain the last opened article, and save.\n\n### Widgets: Advanced Customization\n\nCustomize the knowledge base widget's appearance and behavior using CSS/JavaScript. Methods include modifying the icon, buttons, implementing show/hide callbacks, and customizing styling and localization to match your branding or functionality needs.\n\n### Widgets: Customizing the Widget Icon\n\nCreate a custom button, add JavaScript callbacks to control its visibility based on Knowledge Base widget load status and URL mappings. Integrate these callbacks into the widget's JavaScript snippet. Use JavaScript to make the button open the widget on click. Customize the button's appearance with CSS. Key details include custom button HTML, CSS, JavaScript for callbacks, and integrating them into the widget config.\n\n### Widgets: Customizing Dark Theme\n\n**Method:** Custom CSS. **Target:** Knowledge Base Widget. **Action:** Modify Custom CSS to change background and text colors of the widget's modal and its elements (divs, paragraphs, buttons) to black and white, respectively. The feedback button's hover style and background also modified.\n\n### Widgets: Customizing Displayed Fields\n\nCustomize knowledge base widget text by modifying HTML with JavaScript. Replace \"Page help\", \"Knowledge base\", \"Top search articles\" etc., with localized alternatives in the widget's tabs & search area. Use `$(document).ready` to execute JavaScript after page load. Replace placeholder text via jQuery. Save settings after updating.\n\nTo remove the Page help and Search bar from the widget when URL mapping for a single article is configured, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access the Widget Editor**: Navigate to the Widget section in the Knowledge base portal and edit the desired widget.\n\n2. **Add Custom CSS**: In the Custom CSS tab, add the following code to hide the Page help tab, back icon, and search container:\n\n```css\nli#page-help-tab {\n  display: none;\n}\n.article-header .article-back-icon {\n  display: none;\n}\n.search-container {\n  display: none !important;\n}\n```\n\n3. **Add Custom JavaScript**: In the Custom JavaScript tab, add the following code to ensure the search container is hidden after a delay and to handle any dynamic loading:\n\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  $('.search-container').hide();\n}, 2000);\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  $('#knowledge-base-tab').click();\n}, 2000);\n```\n\n4. **Save Changes**: Click Save to apply the changes.\n\n5. **Cache Considerations**: Note that changes may take up to 15 minutes to appear due to caching. For immediate updates, clear the application cache.\n\nThis approach combines CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic adjustments, ensuring the elements are hidden as intended.\n\n### Widgets: Auto-Opening the Widget\n\nTo automatically open the Knowledge Base widget, add custom JavaScript to the widget's settings. The script simulates a button click after a 2-second delay, ensuring the page fully loads before opening.",

Once customized, the default version cannot be restored, so creating a tailored page is recommended for improving user experience.\n\n### Site Customization: Custom CSS & JS Support\n\nInsufficient data to provide a TLDR. The table lacks any details on custom CSS and JS plans for the Knowledge Base site. A summary requires actual plans, not empty cells.\n\n### Site Customization: Using JavaScript Snippets\n\nCustomize website JavaScript by navigating to site settings, adding code to the JavaScript tab, and saving. Example code reorders elements.\n\n### Site Customization: Troubleshooting Custom JavaScript\n\nDocument360's SPA transition requires updating custom JavaScript, which previously relied on page refresh events.

Contact support for further assistance with persistent issues. Custom CSS is supported. Multiple brands can be accommodated via separate workspaces or by applying separate stylesheets to differing projects within the same workspace while recognizing any CSS added to the projects will apply universally across all workspaces.\n\n### Site Customization: Using CSS Snippets\n\nCSS snippets are reusable code blocks for common CSS functionalities, helping save time and reduce errors. An example is the `.shadow` snippet adding box-shadows. To use, go to Settings, add custom or preloaded snippets (7 available), and save.

Advanced search filters and keyword operators improve efficiency for users, essential for large organizations with extensive documentation.\n\n### Site Features: Search Attributes\n\nKnowledge base search utilizes article & category titles, tags, slugs (articles and categories), breadcrumbs, and content text. Search prioritizes article titles, then tags, slugs, breadcrumbs, and finally content.\n\n\n### Site Features: Enabling the ‘Show Follow button’ from KB Portal\n\nTo enable the 'Show Follow button':\n\n1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Article settings & SEO**.\n2. In the **Article header** section, toggle on **Show Follow button**.\n\n- This feature is enabled by default for new Private and Mixed projects.\n\n![Reader notification](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot-Enabling_Reader_Notification.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Site Features: Searching Attachments\n\nSearch attachments lets users search PDF files (up to 10MB) within a knowledge base. This finds relevant content even if file names don't match search terms, filtering by categories, articles, API docs and files. Enable via Knowledge base portal settings and requires the \"Show article files\" toggle. Search is limited to article content, titles, slugs and tags if the \"Show attachment tab\" is off.\n\n### Site Features: Advanced Search\n\nAdvanced search allows users to filter results across multiple workspaces and languages, with features like workspace, language, tags, contributors, date, and category filters. Enable it in settings under the Knowledge base portal to access these options. Filters include Workspace (current, all, or specific), Language (current, all, or specific), Tags, Contributor, Date (preset or custom range), and Categories.\n\n### Site Features: Search Filters\n\nKnowledge base search filters allow refining results by category, attachments, workspace (current, all, or specific), and language (current, all, or specific). Filters are located to the left of the search bar.\n\n### Site Features: Search Operators\n\nImplementing search operators (double quotes for exact phrases and minus signs for excluding terms) significantly improves search precision and user satisfaction. Double quotes find exact phrases, while the minus sign excludes results containing a specific word. Crucial to understand the difference between using \"-\" for excluding versus its use as part of the word itself.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\nTo enable the 'No search result feedback' in Document360:\n\n1. **Access Settings**: Click on the gear icon located at the top right corner to open the Settings menu.\n\n2. **Navigate to Knowledge Base Settings**: In the Settings menu, select \"Knowledge base site\".\n\n3. **Open Article Settings**: Within the Knowledge base site section, go to \"Article settings & SEO\".\n\n4. **Locate Search Settings**: In the Article settings, find the \"Search settings\" section, which is usually in an accordion menu. Click to expand it.\n\n5. **Enable Feedback Form**: Toggle the switch next to \"No search result feedback\" to activate it.\n\n6. **Configure Behavior**:\n\n- When enabled, users who perform a search with no results will see a feedback form.\n- If disabled, they will see a blank results page.\n\n7. **Review Feedback**: The feedback submissions can be viewed in the \"Search analytics\" module under the analytics section to help improve the knowledge base.\n\nThis setup ensures that your team can gather user feedback when searches yield no results, aiding in content improvements. The feedback form appears on both the knowledge base site and its widget.\n\n### Site Features: Advanced Search FAQs\n\nAdvanced search allows combined searches across all workspaces/languages with filters. To hide the home page search, customize the header. Exclude articles by hiding, and external search engines are handled by a separate article. Include API documentation by selecting \"All workspaces\" in the search filter. For RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic), search bar adjusts to right-to-left alignment. Search behavior depends on default language selection when mixing RTL/LTR languages. Enable \"Include all workspaces in site searches\" in Article settings within Knowledge base site settings for Document360 1.0 to search all workspaces.\n\n### Site Features: Smart Bars\n\nCustomizable banners/bars in Document360's knowledge base site. Convey information/announcements/updates, tailored to user location, browser, or project language. Enhance user engagement and highlight critical info updates.",

Both require manual translation effort.\n\n### Localization: Language Support FAQs\n\n**Document360 TLDR:** Document360 is a knowledge base platform supporting 49 languages (5/3/2 based on plan). Content isn't auto-translated between languages; bulk translation is needed via the \"All articles\" section. It has three components: a content management system, an online library where users can find answers, and a public-facing website.\n\n### Localization: Supported Languages\n\nDocument360 supports 48 languages for localization, including major languages like English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, as well as regional variants such as English (US), English (UK), Chinese (Simplified), and Portuguese (Brazil).",
    "summary": "## Localization\n\n**TLDR:** Document360 supports 48 languages.  Adding languages requires manual translation effort via either editing existing workspaces or creating new ones.

This feature helps organize content tailored to specific users or product areas, ensuring documentation remains organized, accessible, and relevant, regardless of complexity.\n\n### Content Organization: Workspace Benefits\n\nWorkspaces enhance productivity by ensuring relevant information is accessible to specific audiences, improving content organization, and facilitating team collaboration through structured areas for peer reviews and feedback.\n\n### Content Organization: Getting Started with Workspaces\n\nDocument360 automatically creates a default workspace (\"v1\") upon project creation. Using multiple workspaces streamlines documentation, targeting information for specific users (internal teams and customers), and improves access to relevant content.\n\n### Content Organization: Workspace Use Cases\n\n- **Product-specific documentation:** Organize knowledge bases for multiple SaaS products within a single project, using separate workspaces to maintain clear boundaries for each product.\n- **Audience-specific documentation:** Create dedicated workspaces for different user roles (e.g., developers, end-users, administrators) to provide relevant content and avoid confusion.\n- **Internal and external knowledge bases:** Separate workspaces for internal (e.g., support teams) and external (e.g., customers) documentation, enabling access control and clear content separation.\n\n### Content Organization: Troubleshooting Workspace Issues\n\n404 errors navigating secondary workspaces often stem from the workspace being private, lacking published articles, or hidden articles. Ensure the workspace is public, at least one article is published, and visible within the knowledge base. Workspace status directly impacts visibility and the availability of 'Main workspace' options. The document also covers workspace management, recovery, and display options.

Use tools like Digwebinterface to verify DNS settings. Some registrars like Cloudflare may mask records.\n- **DNS Propagation**: Allow up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate. Check TTL settings if issues persist.\n- **CAA Restrictions**: Check for CAA records restricting SSL providers. Add required CAA entries for Digicert, LetsEncrypt, and Google.\n- **\"This site can't be reached\" Error**: Verify DNS configuration, check for duplicate records, and ensure SSL provider CAA entries are present.\n- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Check certificate expiration, browser settings, and DNS resolver configuration. Try accessing via different browsers or without VPN.\n- **FAQs**:\n- Document360 provides SSL certificates automatically.\n- Custom domains reflect in invitation emails.\n- Multiple domains per project are not supported.\n- Naked domains are those without \"www\" prefix.\n- Domain registrars manage domain purchases and DNS settings.\n\n### Site Configuration: Post-Configuration Steps\n\nKnowledge base site is live on custom subfolder, but needs a redirect from main domain to prevent duplicate content issues with search engines (e.g., `example.com/docs`). Contact Document360 support for this redirect. Configure canonical URL (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`) in knowledge base portal settings to globally indicate preferred URL for search engines. This avoids duplicate content and ensures the correct URL ranks better.\n\n### Site Configuration: Web Server Information\n\nA web server delivers website content (text, images, video, application data) to clients like web browsers. Common web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft IIS, OpenResty, LiteSpeed, and Cloudflare.\n\n### Site Configuration: Enabling Subfolder Hosting\n\n- Enable subfolder hosting by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Custom domain > Subfolder hosting tab** and toggle on the feature. Default path is `/docs`.\n- For custom subfolder paths (e.g., `/help`), enter the desired path and click **Update**. Ensure subfolder hosting is enabled and configure languages for your server.\n- For **KB site 2.0**, customize the Site API path (e.g., `/docs-api`) in the same tab. Both Subfolder and Site API paths must be defined for proper functionality.\n\n> **Note**: Article preview is not supported for custom domains with subfolder hosting. Site API path is separate from API documentation.\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Subfolder Hosting\n\nNginx is an open-source web server that supports hosting websites in subfolders. For more details, refer to the [**Nginx documentation**](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Configuration Resources\n\nNginx location blocks direct requests to different parts of your web server based on URL patterns. There are selection algorithms that determine which location block to use when matching incoming requests. See external Nginx documentation and tutorials for details about configuring and understanding these algorithms.\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Sitemap Proxy\n\nConfigure Nginx to proxy sitemap requests to a backend server. Example uses `example.document360.io`, but replace with your domain (e.g., `your-custom-domain.com`). Supports language-specific sitemaps (e.g., `/sitemap.xml.en`). Ensures proper header forwarding for security and tracking.\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Post-Configuration\n\nAfter configuring the web server, your knowledge base is accessible via both your project's existing URL and your custom domain. This may cause duplicate content, so a redirect from the existing Document360 subdomain URL to your custom domain URL is needed. Contact support to implement this redirect.\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Subfolder Setup\n\nConfigure Nginx by adding location blocks for your desired subdirectory, specifying proxy_pass, headers, and sub_filter directives to rewrite URLs. For multiple workspaces, add separate blocks and redirects. Restart Nginx to apply changes.\n\n### Site Configuration: Nginx Home Page Subfolder\n\nTo host a project's home page on a custom subfolder, add Nginx configuration blocks for each workspace. Each block proxies requests to the Document360 domain and sets appropriate headers. Redirects are used for language-specific paths. After updating the configuration, restart Nginx.\n\n**TLDR;** Configure Nginx with exact location blocks for each subfolder, proxy to Document360, set headers, handle redirects, then restart Nginx. Customization of domains, subfolders, and workspaces is required.\n\n### Site Configuration: ASP.NET Core Subfolder Hosting\n\nHost a knowledge base as a subfolder (`/docs`) of your main website using an ASP.NET Core server. Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Proxy` package and configure a proxy to route requests to the knowledge base's actual server (e.g., `example.document360.io`). Define both the subfolder path and the knowledge base's API path if on KB Site 2.0. Replace example domain with your specific Document360 or custom domain.\n\n### Site Configuration: ASP.NET Core Post-Configuration\n\nDuplicate content issue arises after configuring knowledge base in a custom subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/docs`). A redirect from the original site URL (`example.document360.io`) to the new subfolder URL is required. Contact `support@document360.com` to implement this redirect.\n\n### Site Configuration: IIS Subfolder Hosting\n\nIntegrate knowledge base into existing website via subfolder (`/help`). Pre-requisites include Application Request Routing and URL Rewrite IIS modules. Replace example domain with your Document360 or custom domain.\n\n### Site Configuration: Troubleshooting Nginx Issues\n\nTLDR of common NGINX setup issues and their solutions:\n\n- **Invalid \"location\" Directive**: Ensure location blocks are within a server block. Example configuration:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\nlisten 80;\nserver_name example.com;\nlocation /docs {\n      proxy_pass https://example.document360.io/docs;\n      proxy_set_header Host example.document360.io;\n}\n}\n```\n\n- **Certbot Package Unavailable**: Enable EPEL repository and install Certbot:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install epel-release\nsudo yum install certbot\n```\n\n- **NGINX Configuration Test Failed**: Run `sudo nginx -t`, check error messages, and fix syntax issues. Example correction:\n\n```nginx",

    "text": "## Authentication\n\n### Authentication: SSO Process\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) works through a collaboration between a **Service Provider** (e.g., Document360) and an **Identity Provider (IdP)**. When a user accesses the Service Provider, they are redirected to the IdP to authenticate using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the IdP issues an **Access/ID token**, which the Service Provider validates. This establishes a trust relationship, allowing the user to access SSO-enabled applications without additional sign-ins. Document360 supports multiple IdPs, offering flexibility for users to choose their preferred authentication method.\n\n### Authentication: Identity Providers (IdPs)\n\nAn **Identity Provider (IdP)** is an external entity that manages user identities and authenticates users, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) to access multiple services with one login. It stores credentials and handles logins for various applications. Each stored entity is called a **principal**. Examples include **Okta**, **Entra ID**, **Google**, **ADFS**, and **OneLogin**.\n\n### Authentication: Logging In with SSO\n\nAccess the Document360 Knowledge base portal using SSO. Enter email/domain, click \"Continue with SSO,\" authenticate via your Identity Provider (IdP) login.\n\n- **Step 1:** Navigate to the Knowledge base portal URL.\n- **Step 2:** Input your email or subdomain.\n- **Step 3:** Click \"Continue with SSO.\"\n- **Step 4:** Log in to your IdP.\n- **Result:** Automatically logged into the Knowledge base portal.\n\n### Authentication: IdP-Initiated Sign-In\n\nDocument360 login is possible directly from the Identity Provider (IdP) dashboard if configured. Find the Document360 app within the IdP's dashboard to initiate SSO login, bypassing the need for a separate portal visit. Uses existing SSO credentials.\n\n### Authentication: Supported SSO Standards\n\nDocument360 supports Single Sign-On (SSO) through SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect. SAML 2.0 is a robust standard enabling secure cross-application authentication, while OpenID Connect offers a modern, user-friendly alternative. Both protocols support various Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Okta, ADFS, Google, and others, with comprehensive configuration guides available for setup and removal.\n\n### Authentication: SSO Login - Portal\n\nSSO enables access to the Knowledge base portal using existing credentials from an identity provider, eliminating the need for multiple passwords. The document does not specify which plans (Professional, Business, Enterprise) support SSO.\n\n### Authentication: SSO Login - Site\n\nDocument360's Knowledge base site supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to log in with their existing credentials from another identity provider (IdP), eliminating the need for separate passwords.\n\n### Authentication: SSO Login Process\n\nUse your existing identity provider (IdP) credentials to log into the Document360 Knowledge Base. Visit the site, select your IdP's login button, log into your IdP, and you'll be automatically logged in. SSO login buttons vary based on configurations.\n\n### Authentication: Troubleshooting SSO Login\n\nThe HTTP 500 error during SSO login likely stems from an outdated SAML certificate or incorrect attribute mappings.

Hide the default language name, and display a new \"Example\" label. This is a global change.\n\nTo set dark mode as the default for your Knowledge Base site, you can use custom JavaScript. Here's how:\n\n1. **Access Customization Settings**: Go to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript**.\n\n2. **Add JavaScript**: Paste this snippet into the JavaScript tab to trigger dark mode on page load:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    document.getElementById('darkTheme').click();\n  }, 100);\n});\n```\n\nThen save your changes.\n\n3. **Disable Theme Switching (Optional)**: To enforce dark mode, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site**, select **Dark only** under **Site theme**, and save.\n\nThis ensures dark mode is the default, with the option to prevent users from switching to light mode.

While Markdown can create basic accordions, advanced styling requires CSS/HTML.\n\n### Site Customization: Adding Background Images to Text\n\nTo add a background image to text in a knowledge base site, use custom CSS (via Custom CSS & JavaScript settings). Apply a CSS class to the text element, specifying the background image URL. Then, apply that class to your desired text in HTML. This approach works in the site's editor, either through code view or directly applying the styled element. Web-accessible images are required.\n\n### Site Customization: Sorting Table Content\n\nTo sort tables on a knowledge base site, add custom CSS (to style headers and display sort indicators) and JavaScript (to handle the sorting logic). The CSS styles headers for clickability and displays ascending/descending icons. JavaScript code sorts table rows based on selected column content, maintains current sort state (ascending or descending), and updates the sort indicator in the header. Users click on headers to initiate sorting.\n\n1. Use the HTML `<p>` tag with inline styling to align images. For center alignment, use:\n\n```html\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"[Image-URL]\" /></p>\n```\n\n2. Replace `[Image-URL]` with the image URL from Document360 Drive. To find the URL:\n\n- Navigate to the image in Drive.\n- Click \"View details\" and copy the URL from the file details.\n\n3.

Click **Save** to apply the changes.\n\nTo hide the change password option for readers using custom CSS or JS on Business or Enterprise plans:\n\n1. **Identify the Element**: Locate the HTML element (e.g., button or link) for the change password option. Use browser developer tools to find its class or ID.\n\n2. **CSS Implementation**: Write CSS to hide the element. For example:\n\n```css\n.change-password-link {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\n3. **JavaScript Enhancement**: If the element is dynamically loaded, use a Mutation Observer to detect and hide it when it appears. Alternatively, remove it directly after DOM loads:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {\n  document.querySelector('.change-password-link').remove();\n});\n```\n\n4. **Consider Dynamic Content**: If the site uses AJAX, ensure your script runs after content loads or use a mutation observer for real-time changes.\n\n5. **Test Across Scenarios**: Verify functionality across browsers, devices, and page scenarios, ensuring no accessibility issues arise.\n\n6. **Security Note**: Hiding the UI doesn't prevent direct URL access. Consider backend restrictions for full security.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively hide the change password option while maintaining site functionality.\n\n### Site Customization: Configuring Custom Fonts\n\nTo configure a custom font in Document360, obtain the font details, add the font link to Custom HTML, and add the font family details to Custom CSS. Example: configuring a Google font in Document360.\n\n### Site Customization: Hiding the Category Manager\n\nHide the category manager in Knowledge Base by adding custom CSS. For version 1.0, target `.left_sidebar` and `.left-sidebar-toggle`. For version 2.0, use `site-docs-left-panel-container`. Navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site > Custom CSS & JavaScript**, paste the relevant code, and save.\n\n### Site Customization: Hiding the Left Navigation Bar\n\nCustom CSS/JS can hide the knowledge base's left navigation bar, but users can still display it by clicking a \"Show category\" icon.",

Key tabs: My Plan (change via support), Payment Information, Invoice History. Changing plans requires support for legacy users. Free plan is discontinued. Check the pricing page for current details.\n\n### Billing: Upgrading Your Plan\n\nDocument360 users can upgrade their Professional, Business, Enterprise, Legacy, or Legacy Free plans. Upgrades incur a prorated cost for the remainder of the current billing cycle. Legacy plan upgrades may include credits. Only Owners or users with Billing & Invoice permissions can make changes to the plan.\n\n### Billing: Available Plans\n\nDocument360 offers five subscription plans tailored to different needs: **Professional**, **Business**, **Enterprise**, **Enterprise +**, and a **Startup program**. The **Professional**, **Business**, and **Enterprise** plans differ in features such as storage capacity, translation credits, workspace count, sandbox availability, and team/reader accounts. The **Enterprise +** plan provides dedicated servers for enhanced performance and security, while the **Startup program** offers six months of free access to select plans, followed by a discounted rate. Additional add-ons for storage, languages, and customizations are available across all plans.\n\n### Billing: Plan Comparison\n\nDocument360 offers tiered plans (Professional, Business, Enterprise) with increasing feature sets. Business offers more storage, team collaboration (readers/reviewers), advanced analytics, Workflow Designer, Ticket Deflector, & various AI features compared to Professional. Enterprise expands on Business with substantially more storage, larger teams, a sandbox, IP restrictions, comprehensive AI (including premium support), and health checks. Upgrading from Professional to Enterprise provides all Business and Enterprise features.\n\n### Billing: Upgrading Your Plan\n\nTo upgrade your subscription plan in Document360, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Billing** and click **Change plan**. Choose from Professional, Business, or Enterprise plans. Compare features in the **Compare plans and features** section, then select your plan and click **Let’s talk** to contact the sales team for assistance. [Upgrading from a trial version](/help/docs/upgrading-from-trial-version) directs to specific guidance.\n\n### Billing: Upgrading from Legacy Plans\n\nUsers on legacy pricing plans (pre-August 31, 2024), can't upgrade directly; they need support assistance. Navigate to Billing > Change Plan > Let's Talk > Raise Request. Support team processes upgrade within 2 business days. Contact support for questions.\n\n### Billing: Upgrade FAQs\n\nUpgrading gets you more features, storage, and support. Billing adjusts immediately or at the end of your cycle, with a prorated credit for unused portion when upgrading mid-cycle. Trials are available. Data and settings are preserved. Minimal setup is usually required. Downgrading is possible but may result in feature loss.\n\n### Billing: Upgrading from Legacy Free Plan\n\nThe Free plan was discontinued as of November 2024, but existing users retain access. To upgrade, navigate to **Settings > Billing > My plan**, click **Change plan**, compare features, and select your preferred plan. Click **Let’s talk**, and the Document360 sales team will assist with the upgrade process.\n\n### Billing: Downgrading Your Plan\n\nTo downgrade from your current Document360 plan, navigate to settings, select \"Change plan,\" and choose from Professional, Business, or Enterprise. Compare features and limits to ensure your current usage fits the new plan. The sales team will assist and discuss add-ons for features lost in the downgrade. Check the pricing page for details on plan limitations.\n\n### Billing: Downgrading Your Plan\n\nTo downgrade your Document360 plan, note that some features may no longer be available. Only users with **Owner** permissions or **View and Update** access for **Billing & Invoice** can make changes. You can downgrade from:\n\n- [Enterprise to Business](/help/docs/downgrading-your-plan#enterprise-to-business)\n- [Business to Professional](/help/docs/downgrading-your-plan#business-to-professional)\n- [Enterprise to Professional](/help/docs/downgrading-your-plan#enterprise-to-professional)\n\n### Billing: Downgrade - Plan Comparison\n\nDowngrading loses features and capacity. Enterprise to Business: Reduced storage, users, reviewers, and some AI tools (with reduced credits). Business to Professional: Losses in workflow tools, analytics, integrations, AI summarization, and reduced storage and users. Enterprise to Professional loses all Enterprise and Business features. Storage, user limits, and AI credits decrease significantly. Some features are retained with reduced capacity or access to specific tools.\n\n### Billing: Downgrade Considerations\n\nDowngrading retains most existing data and some features but limits new content creation, removes access to some features, and restricts add-on usage based on the lower plan's capabilities. Data exceeding plan limits may be lost. Existing articles, tags, feedback, and PDF exports are generally preserved, but new creation, editing, and customization are restricted. Widget and custom JS/CSS functionality are also affected by the reduced plan.\n\n### Billing: Downgrade FAQs\n\nDowngrading preserves data but may limit features and storage. Billing adjusts with a potential credit. Features tied to the higher plan might be lost, but data remains. Upgrade is possible later, but limits from the lower plan apply until upgraded again. Review new plan details before downgrading and consult support if needed.\n\n### Billing: Downgrading from Legacy Plans\n\nLegacy pricing plan users (subscribed before 31st August 2024) must contact support to downgrade. Navigate to the Billing page, select \"Change plan,\" click \"Let's talk,\" and raise a request. Support will review and process within two working days. For additional help, contact support via email, live chat, or phone.\n\n### Billing: Post-Downgrade Tips\n\n- After downgrading, review your content and update workflows, communicate changes to your team, monitor usage, and consider future needs.
