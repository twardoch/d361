## My projects

The **project dashboard** is the first thing you see when logging in to [**Document360**](https://portal.document360.io). The dashboard features all the projects you own, projects associated with a team account, and projects associated with a reader.  
Here, each project will have a visibility tag to indicate the type of project (public, private, or mixed).

### 1. Dashboard

This page provides an overview of your entire project and serves as a hub for contributors. In the **Overview** section, Team accounts can access information such as created articles, published articles, drafts, and the performance insights of published articles (views, reads, likes, and dislikes). You can use the filter option to select the time frame. You can also view other project-related information including **Recently seen**, **Team accounts**, **Readers**, **Drive capacity**, **Broken links**, **No result searches** and **Last backed up** date.

### 2. Documentation

The **Documentation** page is where you'll create and maintain the tree-view folder structure of categories that will keep your articles organized. Start a knowledge base by creating a Category and then populate them with Subcategory and Articles.

Drag and drop categories and articles to reorder, hide, rename, and delete them using the More options () menu that appears when you hover your mouse over any item on the Category manager (left navigation pane).

![ocument360 user interface showing navigation menus for managing articles, workflow assignments, starred items, recycle bin, site builder, content tools, and categories/articles hierarchy.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view.png)

#### a. All articles

The **All articles** section allows you to perform bulk operations (publish, hide, move, delete, etc.) on multiple articles at once, saving time compared to performing these actions individually on each article.

![Document360's 'All articles' interface showing a list of articles with editing options like publish, hide, move, delete, review reminder, and live status, as well as features for reusing content through templates, variables, snippets, and a glossary.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/6_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_all_articles.png)

#### b. Workflow assignments

The Workflow assignments section gives you an idea about what the team is currently working on, and any recently published articles.

![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_workflow_assignments.png)

Any articles that you are assigned will show up on this page. You can filter articles based on the following workflow statuses: **Draft**, **In review**, or **Published**. If you missed the review due date for any article, it will appear under the **Overdue** category.

![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7.1_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_workflow_assignments_page.png)

#### c. Starred

The Starred section contains the articles you marked as favorites. This allows quick access to important articles.

![Document360's 'Starred' interface showing a list of articles with the respective tags and article status, along with an arrow pointing at 'Starred' on the left navigation panel](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_starred.png)

#### d. Recycle bin

The Recycle bin section includes a list of articles and categories deleted in the past 30 days. You can restore the deleted categories and articles in the available time frame.

![Document360's 'Recycle bin' interface showing an empty recycle bin, along with an arrow pointing at 'Recycle bin' on the left navigation panel](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_recycle_bin.png)

#### e. Site builder

You can personalize the look and feel of your knowledge base site from the **Site builder** section.

![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/10_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_site_builder.png)

You can choose the desired logo and icon for your knowledge base site. From this section, you can also customize the brand colors, font, and styling of the site.

#### f. Content tools

The **Content tools**, as the name implies, contain all the necessary tools to manage your article and project content.

![5_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Content_tools](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/11_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_content_tools.png)

You can manage the following features from this menu.

* **Content reuse** - Manage all the variables, snippets, templates, and the glossary.
* **Import and Export** - Manage all your project import and export activities from this section. In this section, you can export your content as a PDF or migrate content from other knowledge management tools.
* **Content essentials** - Manage the project-level find and replace, review reminders, tags, and SEO descriptions from the menu.
* **Feedback manager** - View and respond to articles and no search feedback from a unified module.
* **Workflow designer** - Craft your workflow statuses and sequence from this section.

#### g. Categories & Articles (Category manager)

Writing and publishing articles in Document360 is simple: pick your category, create an article(title and slug), add SEO details, and publish to your knowledge base.

When you update or edit an article (Fork), Document360 will create a new Article revision without affecting the live/public workspace.

![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles.png)

You can make the necessary changes and republish when you're ready. You can identify the articles easily using the Article status indicators (Yellow dot). Document360 maintains all the workspaces to check the differences between them.

### 3. API documentation

The API documentation feature in Document360 provides a complete solution for creating and managing API references. This feature allows you to create high-quality API documentation that helps users understand and consume your APIs effectively.

![13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation.png)

This API module includes the **Try it!** feature, which allows the users to test the API endpoints within the Knowledge base site. You can create dedicated versions of your API documentation. The feature provides an intuitive interface for uploading API references as URLs or JSON/YAML files. After uploading the OpenAPI definition, the interactive API endpoint articles are created in the Knowledge base portal. Now, end users can access the **Try it!** option with the available endpoints, parameters, and responses in the API documentation on the Knowledge base site.

---

### 4. Analytics

Document360 includes an **Analytics** menu with tools to help you understand end-user engagement with your knowledge base.

![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Analytics](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/14_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_analytics.png)

Here is the list of metrics and modules you can track with the Analytics tool:

* **Articles**
* **Eddy AI**
* **Search**
* **Team accounts**
* **Feedback**
* **Links status**
* **Page not found**
* **Ticket deflector**

---

### 5. Widget

The Knowledge base widget (previously known as *Knowledge base assistant* (or) *In-app assistant*) helps readers find their answers without leaving your site or application.

![8_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Widget](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/15_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_widgets.png)

You can update the following Knowledge base widget settings from this menu.

* **Installation & setup**
* **Custom CSS**
* **Custom JavaScript**
* **URL mapping**

---

### 6. Drive

Centralized and cloud-based storage for Document360 projects that stores and let team members manage all the Knowledge base artifacts (files). If you have already used any other heavyweights, such as Google Drive or OneDrive, getting accustomed to the functions in Document360 Drive should be relatively easy. You can access your Drive by clicking the Drive icon on the left menu.

![7_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Drive](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/16_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_drive.png)

---

### 7. Settings

You can set and configure all aspects of the project and knowledge base in the **Project settings** such as inviting team members, editing notification settings, configuring domains, setting up article redirects, and more.

![9_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Settings](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/17_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_settings.png)

The different features are mapped under the following classifications in the Settings menu:

* **Knowledge base portal**
* **Knowledge base site**
* **Users & Security**
* **AI Features**

---

### 8. Search

A dedicated space to search the entire project content is now available on the Knowledge base portal. Perform a combined search across all the workspaces and languages simultaneously. The search bar is available at the top of all the modules and pages in the Knowledge base portal.

![10_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Search](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/18_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_search.png)

The search engine works similarly to the other search functionalities in the portal. Type in the keyword and narrow the results using filters such as workspace, language, visibility, tags, and date range. You can preview the article/category page, and then preview the article or navigate to the article in the Editor.

![11_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Search_results](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/19_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_search_bar_dropdown.png)

As the search is performed universally in the project, it covers files. Users can switch between the article and Drive search using the tabs below the search bar.

---

### 9. Open site

The Open site () action is used to navigate to and view the Knowledge base site. Clicking the icon will take you to the Knowledge base site of the workspace that is currently open in your knowledge base portal. If you are in the API documentation workspace, the Open site action will take you to the API documentation home page. If your API documentation site does not have a home page, you will be directed to the first article or category page in the API documentation.

---

## Knowledge base site

The Knowledge base site is the website that end-users will access to read articles and find helpful answers.

Set your knowledge base access settings to public, private, or mixed. **Public** means it is accessible to anyone on the internet, **Private** is restricted by login screens, and **Mixed** combines elements of both public and private attributes.

![14_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_site_overview](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/20_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_site_preview.png)
