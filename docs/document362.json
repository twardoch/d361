Inspect the page to check for loading time issues:\n\n   * Right-click on the page and select **Inspect**.\n   * Check the console for error messages and monitor loading times.\n   * If you see an invalid login persisting for a long time, your system’s time settings may be incorrect.\n4.

To clear your project’s cache in Document360, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the specific location in the Knowledge base portal where you need to clear the cache.\n2. You can open the developer tools:\n\n   1. On Windows: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I`.\n   2. On macOS: Press `Cmd+Shift+I`.\n3. Right-click and hold the **refresh** button.\n4. Select **Empty Cache and Hard Reload** from the menu.\n\n#### Why am I unable to log in to my Document360 account? The callback URL is not working.\n\nThis issue may occur due to an intermittent cache issue or an incorrect system time setting on your device. If your system's internal clock is not synchronized with your time zone or region, it can cause login failures, including issues with the callback URL (`portal.document360.io/callback`).\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n* Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try logging in again.\n* Verify your system time settings and ensure they are correctly synchronized with your time zone.\n\n![Webpage displaying a loading document360 icon and a highlighted URL in the address bar.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot-Callback_while_logging.png)\n\n<a id=\"document360-my-projects\"></a>",

Password-cracking tools often come with dictionary lists that will try thousands of familiar names and words.\n\n  + If you must use dictionary words, try adding numbers and special characters to them, such as \"In$t@llat10n.\"\n* Don’t use simple adjacent keyboard combinations like \"qwerty,\" \"asdzxc,\" \"abcdef,\" or \"123456.\" These are generic and easy to crack.\n\n---",

    "text": "## Best practices\n\nHere at **Kovai.co**, we believe that best practices create secure and robust applications. We recommend that Document360 users follow our list of best practices to prevent unexpected data loss or unauthorized access.\n\n### List of best practices:\n\n1. **We do not recommend publicly sharing the API key via less-secured networks,** as it can result in unauthorized data access. The key can be used to view or exploit your data. In such a case, we recommend deleting the key immediately and creating a new API key for your usage.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/creating-document360-api-tokens).\n\n2. **We recommend giving** **an API key only the required permissions**, as this helps keep the data in safe hands and prevents unauthorized users from modifying it. For example, to view an *\"example\"* set of data, the API key only needs the GET method. This does not let users modify the data using the API key.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/creating-document360-api-tokens).\n\n3. **We suggest that the team manager give each user the correct access rights,** as most of our customers have a team that has access rights to the documentation. We simplify this by having roles corresponding to a certain access rights level.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/team-roles-and-permissions-explained).\n\n4. **We recommend that** **users take advantage of the backup functionalities**. The project will be automatically backed up every day at 00:00 UTC. You can also manually back up your project anytime to keep the changes made safe.  Both of these will back up the Settings, Landing Page, Documentation, and Entire Project contents and can be restored at any time to return to a previous version. This process is made available to keep the users in control and to prevent data loss.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/backup-restore).\n\n5. **We recommend you use the option to make the document private if needed**. Various customers have different use cases for our product. You might want the documentation to be visible to the public or internal team members. The project owners can make the documentation private in the latter case and make it not visible to the public.\n\n> For more information, click [**here**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/making-a-knowledge-base-private).\n\n---",

The content within an iframe is a separate web page displayed within a specific section of another web page. Due to its ability to embed external content, managing iframe usage with security settings such as X-Frame options is crucial to prevent security risks like clickjacking.\n\n#### What are the embedded tags that I can restrict with the X-Frame options?\n\nThe X-Frame options setting allows you to control whether your knowledge base can be embedded in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>` tags on external domains.\n\n#### Why are X-Frame options important?\n\nThe X-Frame options are vital for security as they help prevent clickjacking attacks, where an attacker embeds your knowledge base in a malicious website. This embedding tricks users into performing unintended actions. Enabling X-Frame options ensures your knowledge base cannot be embedded on external domains, safeguarding user interactions.\n\n#### How can I configure the X-Frame options for my knowledge base?\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users & security** > **Security**\n2. Locate the toggle labeled **Enable X-Frame options** and switch it on to prevent your knowledge base from being embedded on unauthorized external domains.\n\n#### Can I allow specific domains to embed my Knowledge Base?\n\nYes, you can specify the allowed domains in the Frame source of content security policy setting. For more information, see the [content security policy](/docs/content-security-policy) article.\n\n#### How can I test if my X-Frame options are working?\n\nYou can test if your X-Frame options are correctly configured by:\n\n1. Using your browser’s developer tools and checking the **Network** tab to inspect response headers for the **X-Frame-Options** setting.\n2. Using third-party services like [securityheaders.com](http://securityheaders.com) to verify that the correct X-Frame-Options header is applied.\n\n#### What are the potential risks of not using X-Frame options?\n\nIf the X-Frame options are not enabled for your knowledge base, it may be embedded in an iframe on another website without your authorization. This lack of control exposes your site to clickjacking attacks, where attackers overlay invisible or misleading elements over your interface to trick users into performing unintended actions, such as divulging passwords or clicking on malicious links. Such vulnerabilities can compromise user security and potentially lead to data breaches.\n\n#### What is clickjacking?\n\nClickjacking, also known as UI redressing or UI masking, is a malicious technique where attackers trick users into clicking on a button or link that is hidden or obscured within a web page or application. This is often achieved by overlaying a transparent layer with deceptive elements over a legitimate website or application. Users may think they are interacting with the actual site, but in reality, they are engaging with elements controlled by the attacker. Such interactions can lead to adverse outcomes, like downloading malware, making unauthorized purchases, or inadvertently sharing sensitive information. Utilizing security settings like X-Frame options can help protect against such attacks by preventing unauthorized embedding of your content.\n\n#### What is a malicious website?\n\nA malicious website is a site designed to cause harm to visitors or their devices. These sites may trick visitors into downloading malware, stealing personal information, or engaging in fraudulent activities. Using X-Frame options helps prevent your content from being embedded on such sites, enhancing your security measures against these risks.\n\nAn online library where users can find information about a product, service, department, or topic.

Here, **syntax** represents the way you type the content in your editor. You can use the examples in the **Example** column as reference.\n\nFor some Markdown commands, you also have alternate keyboard shortcuts, which you can use to quickly format your text. You can find these shortcuts in the **Notes** column in the below table.\n\n| Feature | Syntax | Example | Output | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Headings (H2, H3, H4)** | `##`, `###`, `####` before the text | `## Heading 2` | Heading 2 | This syntax helps in creating section titles. Use 1-6 hash symbols for heading levels. Document360 restricts H1 for article titles. |\n| **Bold** | `**text**` | `**bold**` | **bold** | This syntax helps emphasize important text. Shortcut: Ctrl+B / Cmd+B |\n| **Italics** | `*text*` or `_text_` | `*italics*` | *italics* | This syntax helps highlight text subtly. Shortcut: Ctrl+I / Cmd+I |\n| **Strikethrough** | `~~text~~` | `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ | This syntax helps to cross out text. No shortcut available |\n| **Numbered List** | `1.` followed by text | `1. First item` | 1.

Once forked, you can modify the conditions as needed.\n\n**If an article is translated into multiple languages, does conditional content apply to all languages?**\n\nYes, the conditions set on a content block will apply across all translated versions of the article. However, if different visibility rules are needed for different languages, you will need to apply conditions specifically for each translation.\n\n**What happens if no conditions are met?**\n\nIf no conditions are met, the content block will behave according to the default visibility rules. By default, the block will be visible to all users unless explicitly set to **Hide** for all conditions.\n\n**If I change the project type from Private to Public, what happens to the conditions?**\n\nIf your project type changes from **Private to Public**, any conditions using parameters like **IP address** or **Reader groups** (which are only applicable in private/mixed projects) will be automatically disabled, and those parameters will no longer be available for selection.\n\n**What happens to conditional content if I clone a article?**\n\nIf you clone a article that contains conditional content blocks, all the conditions will be copied over as they are. You can then edit the conditions in the duplicated article if needed.\n\n**Can I apply multiple \"Or\" conditions?**\n\nYes, you can apply multiple **OR** conditions. For example, if you want to show content to users in either **India** or **USA**, you can set the condition **Country equals India OR Country equals USA**. The content will be visible to users from either country.\n\n**Can conditions be time-bound?**\n\nYes, conditions can be time-bound by using the **Date** parameter. For example, if you want content to be visible only between specific dates, you can set the condition **Date between Dec 1, 2024, and Dec 10, 2024**. The content will automatically stop being visible after Dec 10, 2024.\n\n**What happens if I delete a reader group that is part of a condition?**\n\nIf a reader group that is part of a conditional content block is deleted, the condition associated with that group will no longer be applied.\n\n**Can I apply conditions based on the user's session (e.g., logged-in vs. logged-out users)?**\n\nAt this time, conditional content does not apply directly to user session status (logged-in or logged-out).\n\n**If I move an article with conditional content between workspaces, do the conditions still apply?**\n\nYes, the conditional content blocks and their conditions will move along with the article when it is transferred between workspaces. However, you should verify that the conditions are still relevant in the new workspace.\n\n**How do conditions affect articles that have multiple versions (e.g., published and draft versions)?**\n\nConditional content settings are version-specific. If you fork an article to create a new version, the conditions set in the original version will carry over to the new version. You can then edit the conditions in the new version as needed.\n\n**Is there a limit to the number of conditions I can apply to a single block?**\n\nYes, you can apply up to 25 conditions per article. However, for performance and clarity, it is recommended to limit the number of complex conditions to ensure that content loads efficiently and is easy to manage.\n\n<a id=\"tables-in-advanced-wysiwyg-editor\"></a>",

This ensures the tab is placed correctly.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7_GIF-Moving_tabs_to_the_left.gif)\n\n* **Moving a tab to the first position:** To place a tab at the very beginning of the list, drag it near the first tab. Hold until a **blue line** appears on top of the first tab, then drop it.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_GIF-Moving_tabs_to_the_first_position.gif)\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> For better control, drag tabs slowly and make small adjustments to avoid accidental replacements.\n\n---",

    "text": "## Categories and subcategories\n\nIn Document360, Category and Subcategory is essential for organizing and displaying articles on similar topics. They function as folders that group related content, offering a structured approach to knowledge management.\n\nImagine you manage a product support knowledge base for an e-commerce platform. You create a category called **Shipping Information** with subcategories like **Domestic shipping**, **International shipping**, **Shipping rates**, and **Delivery times**. This structure enables customers to easily find the exact information they need, reducing frustration and improving their overall experience.\n\n![Document360 interface showing categories, articles, and their publication statuses for user guidance.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Catagory_n_subcategory_in_portal.png)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What are categories and subcategories in documentation?\n\nCategories and subcategories are organizational structures in a knowledge base used to group related articles by topic. This makes it easier for users to navigate and find relevant information.\n\n#### How do categories and subcategories differ?\n\nCategories represent broad topics, while subcategories provide more specific divisions within those topics. Articles are hierarchically organized under subcategories, which are grouped under their respective parent categories.\n\n#### Why do I need subcategories?\n\nSubcategories help segment information into smaller, focused groups, enhancing understanding, accessibility, and navigation.\n\n**Example:** If \"Cars\" is the main category, subcategories like \"Sedan,\" \"SUV,\" and \"Convertible\" allow users to quickly locate content specific to their interests.\n\n#### Can I customize the categories and subcategories?\n\nYes, Document360 allows team accounts to create, edit, and delete categories and subcategories based on organizational needs. Customization options include changing icons for better visual appeal.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> For more information, read the article on Managing categories.\n\n#### How can categories and subcategories improve knowledge base usability?\n\nLogical groupings simplify browsing, enabling readers to find relevant information without sifting through unrelated content.\n\n#### Can a single article belong to multiple categories or subcategories?\n\nYes, you can display an article in multiple categories or subcategories using the **Replicate** () option in Document360.\n\n#### What is the best practice for naming categories and subcategories?\n\nUse clear and descriptive names that reflect the content contained within each category or subcategory. Avoid jargon and aim for user-friendly naming conventions.\n\n#### How should I organize my categories and subcategories for optimal user experience?\n\nStructure categories and subcategories based on logical relationships and user needs. A tree-like format broad categories divided into specific subcategories works best.\n\n**Example:** In the Document360 Knowledge base, categories and subcategories align with the sequential flow of features and menus in the portal.\n\n#### Can I apply different access permissions to certain categories or subcategories?\n\nYes, Document360 supports role-based content access control, allowing restrictions on specific categories or subcategories. If no explicit restrictions are set, permissions inherit from parent categories.\n\n#### Is it possible to reorder categories and subcategories after they are created?\n\nYes, Document360 lets you reorder categories and subcategories using the drag-and-drop () icon.\n\n#### Why is the category/subcategory not visible on my Knowledge base site? How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA category or subcategory might not appear on the site in the following scenarios:\n\n* All articles within it are hidden or not published.\n* The category/subcategory is empty, with no articles added.\n\nTry the below steps if the category tree fails to load on the Knowledge base site:\n\n* Check if JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.\n* Clear your browser cache and cookies to resolve potential caching issues.\n* Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version.\n* Test the category tree on a different browser or device to verify if the issue is browser-specific.\n\nOrganizes related articles under a common theme in the knowledge base.\n\nA secondary category in Document360 used to organize and display groups of related articles.

It commonly happens in the following scenarios:\n\n* Creating a **large number of articles** within a category or project that exceeds the allowed limit.\n* **Bulk importing** a significant number of articles into a category.\n* Adding a **page type subcategory** within another category.\n\n**Steps to resolve**\n\n1. Check if the error occurs across **all categories** in your workspace.\n2. In Document360, the maximum number of articles per category and per project depends on your plan:\n\n   **Category limits**\n\n   * Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans: Up to **100 articles per category**.\n\n   **Project Limits**\n\n   * Professional & Business plans: Up to **5,000 articles per workspace**.\n   * Enterprise plan: Up to **10,000 articles per workspace**.\n3. If your workspace has exceeded these limits, reduce the number of articles in a category or upgrade your plan if needed.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n![Overview of document categories and articles with highlighted error message that indicates the article creation limit is reached.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1739518144665.png)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What is the character limit for article titles?\n\nThe character limit for article titles is 150 characters, including spaces. Special characters like $, %, \\*, {, }, \", <, and > are not allowed.\n\n#### What are the best practices for creating an article title and URL slug?\n\nWhen creating an article title, remember that the URL slug is derived from the title. Document360 automatically separates words with hyphens and removes special characters/punctuation in the slug. Further updates to the URL slug can be made later.\n\n#### How can I identify the published status of an article?\n\nThe published status of an article is indicated by a colored dot next to the article name:\n\n* Light blue dot: A new article which is not yet published.\n* Light green dot: The article is published.\n\n#### Do I need to save my content frequently?\n\nNo, Document360 automatically saves your content every 5 seconds. You can also save manually using **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac).\n\n#### What should I do if I cannot access an article or see recent updates?\n\nIf you’re having trouble accessing an article or viewing recent updates, try the following steps:\n\n* Refresh the page.\n* Ensure the article title or link is correct.\n* Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again.\n* If the article was recently published or updated, allow a few moments for the changes to reflect.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n#### What happens after I create a new article from a template?\n\nYour article will be added to the respective category/subcategory with a New article status indicator (light-blue dot).\n\n#### What happens after an article is published?\n\nAfter an article is published, it will appear in your Knowledge base site for readers, and its status will be updated from Draft to Published in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n#### How can I edit a published article?\n\nTo edit a published article, click the **Edit** button at the top-right of the editor. This will change the article status back to Draft, allowing you to make changes.\n\n#### What happens when I publish an edited article?\n\nWhen you publish an edited article, the edited version replaces the previously published version in your Knowledge base.\n\n#### Is the 'Edit article' option available for all readers in the Knowledge base site?\n\nNo, the 'Edit article' option is only available for logged-in team accounts on the Knowledge base site.\n\n#### What happens when an article is locked because a user is editing it, and how can it be released?\n\nIn Document360, when a user begins editing an article, the article is locked, preventing others from making changes. This lock is automatically released 15 minutes after the user stops editing, at which point the article becomes available for other users to edit.\n\nIf you need to unlock it before that time, the user editing the article can manually click **Unlock** () icon at the top of the article, near the preview.\n\n#### Can I move articles from one project to another?\n\nThe inbuilt move functionality to move articles from one project to another is currently unavailable.  As a workaround, when transferring multiple articles, use the export feature to save the articles along with all media files from the original project, then import them into the new project. Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste content from articles in one project to another. As a best practice, upload images from the original article to the drive of the new project and then insert them into the new article.\n\n#### What happens to the links and references within an article when it is moved to a new category or workspace?\n\nWhen you move an article to a new category or workspace, all internal links and references within the article will be updated automatically to reflect the new location. This ensures that all links and references remain functional.\n\n#### Are there any security restrictions when moving articles across workspaces?\n\nYes, security restrictions will apply based on the destination workspace and category. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to move articles to the target workspace and category.\n\n#### What is a hidden article?\n\nA hidden article will not be listed in the Knowledge base site and cannot be accessed through the direct link, but will appear in the Knowledge base portal for internal use.\n\n#### How can I hide a single article?\n\nTo hide a single article, navigate to  **Documentation** () in the Knowledge base portal, hover over the desired article, click on the **More** () icon, and select **Hide**.\n\n#### Can I hide multiple articles at once?\n\nYes, you can hide multiple articles at once by navigating to the **All articles** () section in **Documentation** (), selecting the desired articles, and clicking the **Hide** option at the top of the pane.\n\n#### Will hidden articles appear in search results?\n\nNo, hidden articles are excluded from search results.\n\n#### How can I hide an article from the Knowledge base site while still allowing access via its URL?\n\nTo hide an article while maintaining access through its URL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to Settings () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site**.\n2. Click on **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.\n3. Paste the following code in the JavaScript tab:\n\n```\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('a[href=\"SLUG NAME\"]').parent().css({\"display\": \"none\"});\n    $('a[href=\"SLUG NAME\"]').parent().css({\"display\": \"none\"});\n});\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n4. Click **Save**.\n\n#### How do I restore my deleted articles?\n\nYou can restore your deleted articles from the **Recycle bin**. The deleted articles will remain in the Recycle bin for 30 days. For more information, read the article on [Recycle bin](/help/docs/recycle-bin-recent-and-starred-files).\n\n#### Why doesn't the article name change reflect on the Knowledge base site?\n\n* If the article is in **Draft** status, the change in the article name doesn't reflect immediately on the site. The article name change will only be reflected after publishing it.\n* If the article is in **Published** status, the change in the article name will reflect immediately on the Knowledge base site.\n\n#### Can I clone and replicate articles across different workspaces?\n\nYou can clone articles within or across workspaces. However, replication is limited to the same workspace.\n\n#### What happens if I delete the source article of a replicated article?\n\nIf the source article is deleted, the replicated articles will also be removed from their respective categories.\n\n#### Is there a limit to the number of times an article can be replicated or cloned?\n\nDocument360 does not limit the number of times you can replicate or clone articles, allowing flexibility in content management.\n\n#### Why am I getting 404 errors when trying to access articles other than the homepage or the first article? How do I resolve it?\n\nThis issue typically occurs due to incorrect slug configuration or folder name changes in the subfolder hosting page. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Verify article slugs: Ensure the slugs for your articles are correctly configured. For example, the first article might load using the slug /docs, but other articles may require a different slug, such as /help. In such cases, make sure all the slugs are consistent.\n2. Check subfolder settings: Navigate to the subfolder hosting page and confirm if the `/docs` folder has been renamed or altered. If it has been renamed, update it back to `docs` to maintain consistency.\n3. Test access: After correcting the folder name, try accessing the articles again to confirm the issue is resolved.\n4. Clear cache and perform hard refresh:\n\n   a. Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect to open the developer tools menu.\n\n   b. Right-click the browser's reload button and choose Hard reload or Empty cache and Hard reload.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n Provide the following details:\n\n* Screenshots or video recordings of the subfolder hosting page.\n* Information about any recent changes to your website or system settings.\n* An exported CSV file from the article redirect rule feature.\n\nThe platform where project members manage and create content for the knowledge base.

Navigate to the desired category in the **Categories & Articles** pane.\n4. Click the **More ()** icon next to the category name.\n5. Select **Add article** > **Import ().** The **Import** window will appear.\n6. **Drag and drop** the .docx source document or click **Upload a file** to import it from your local storage.\n7. Click **Replace** if you want to select a different .docx source document.\n8. Select the **Multiple articles** tab in the Import window.\n9. Select the location where your media files should be saved from the **Drive location** dropdown menu.\n10. Select the desired heading levels (e.g., H1, H2) in the field labeled **\"Which heading levels create a new article?\"** for splitting the document into articles. By default, **H1** is selected and cannot be removed. For example:\n\n    * If only H1 is selected, a new article is created at the start of each H1.\n    * If both H1 and H2 are selected, a new article is created at each H1, and H2 headings within an H1 section will also create separate articles. This is helpful when your document has multiple subsections that you want to organize as individual articles for better clarity and navigation.\n11. Click **Proceed** to process the document based on the selected heading levels.\n\nAfter processing, a list of articles will appear, with the heading text from the .docx file serving as the article name for each generated article. The **Category** fields are also auto populated based on the category you selected in step 3. You can select a different category from the dropdown menu.\n\nWhen you hover over an article in the article list, the **Merge**, **Preview**, and **Delete** options are displayed.\n\n* Click the **Merge** option to merge a sub-heading article with its parent article. This will combine the sub-heading article (e.g., created from H2) into the parent article (e.g., created from H1).\n* Click the **Preview** option to view the content of the article.\n* Click the **Delete** option to delete the article.\n\n11. Once you are done reviewing the articles, click **Import** to finish importing the articles to your knowledge base. A success message will confirm that the articles have been imported.\n12. Click Done to close the Import window. The imported articles will now appear in the selected category.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> * Images in the Word document will be uploaded as individual files in the selected Drive folder.\n> * Document360 retains all external hyperlinks in the imported article.\n\n![Importing a document as multiple articles](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_ScreenGIF-Importing_multiple_article.gif)\n\n---",

    "text": "## Determining editors while importing .docx files\n\nWhen importing articles from Word files, the editor used will be based on your selection in the Knowledge base portal settings. Follow these steps to check or change your editor selection:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Knowledge base portal** > **General** > **Editor**.\n2. Select the editor to determine how articles are imported:\n\n   1. Choose Markdown or WYSIWYG editors to import Word files using the WYSIWYG editor.\n   2. Choose the Advanced WYSIWYG editor to import Word files using the Advanced WYSIWYG editor.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**What is the best practice for managing large documents in the Advanced WYSIWYG editor?**\n\nAs a best practice, split large documents into multiple articles for better performance and easier management. For instance, if you are importing content from a Word file, you can use the [**Import Word File into Multiple Articles**](/help/docs/article-import-from-word-files) feature for a more efficient workflow.\n\n**What is the maximum file size for .docx files that can be imported?**\n\nThe .docx file size should be less than 15MB. If your Word file exceeds this limit, you will get an error saying, ‘*File size can’t be larger than 15 MB*’ and you will need to split the file into smaller parts before attempting to import the file again.\n\n**Can I import multiple .docx files at once?**\n\nYou can import only one .docx at a time. However, during the upload, you can choose to import it as either a single article or multiple articles.\n\n**Is it possible to import Word files using the Markdown editor?**\n\nNo, importing Word files (.docx) is not supported in the Markdown editor.\n\n**Why am I facing an error while importing a Word document into Document360?**\n\nThere are several reasons for errors when importing Word documents into Document360:\n\n1. **Missing or empty headers in the Table of Contents (TOC)**\n\nIf your document contains missing or empty headers in the TOC section, this can cause an error saying “*An item with the same key has already been added*” during the import process. To resolve this, remove any empty or missing headers from the TOC and then try importing the file again. Once corrected, the import should work as expected.\n\n2. **Firewall blocking the upload**\n\nAnother potential issue could be related to your network firewall. If your firewall is blocking the upload, you might receive an object error. In such cases, ensuring that the Word document upload is allowed in your firewall settings should resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Password-protected or restricted files**\n\nWord files that are password-protected or restricted to specific users cannot be imported. Ensure the file is accessible to everyone.\n\n4. **Conflicting styles between Microsoft Word and Google Docs**\n\nIf a Word file was created in Microsoft Word and later modified in Google Docs, changes to the heading styles in Google Docs can result in duplicate or conflicting styles. This occurs because Microsoft Word and Google Docs handle styles differently, leading to mismatched style tags. To resolve this:\n\na. After uploading the Word document to Google Docs, apply the default Google Docs styles to the document.  \nb. This will reset all styles to Google Docs' default settings, removing any duplicated or conflicting styles.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n**Why do I see the error “You have reached the maximum number of articles you can have in a project”?**\n\nThis error occurs when the number of articles in your project exceeds the allowed limit. If you are importing a Word file, Document360 uses heading tags to divide the file into multiple articles. For example, if the Word file generates 10 articles, but the target category has a soft limit that allows fewer than 10 articles, this error may occur. As a solution,\n\n1. Review the heading tags in your Word file to understand how the content is structured and split into articles.\n2. Adjust the heading structure in the Word file to reduce the number of articles generated during the import.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n<a id=\"publishing-an-article\"></a>",

This ensures image stability and prevents broken image links if the image is removed or renamed in the future.\n\n#### Can I customize the appearance of the inserted images?\n\nYes, you can customize the alignment, size, and style of inserted images to suit your preferences and optimize the visual presentation within your articles.\n\n#### How can I ensure accessibility for visually impaired users when adding images?\n\nYou can provide alternative text (alt text) for each image, which helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired users and improves search engine optimization (SEO) for your Knowledge base.\n\n#### How can I add icons in line with text?\n\nTo add icons in the markdown editor, simply paste the HTML code snippet of the icon wherever you want it to appear in your text. For example, use `<nor class=\"fa-light fa-comment\"></nor>` for a comment icon.\n\nIf you are using the advanced WYSIWYG editor, place the cursor where you want the icon, switch to code view, and paste the same HTML code snippet. After pasting, save the file and switch back to the regular view. You should now see the icon in line with your text. You can find these icon snippets on websites like FontAwesome.\n\n#### Will images copied from any external source that are pasted into Document360 be permanently stored? If yes, what happens when the external source is deleted?\n\nIf images from any external source are copied and pasted into Document360, they will be stored in the Document360 Drive. However, it is recommended to upload images directly from the Drive rather than pasting them to ensure they are not linked to any external sources.\n\nIf the images point to any external source as their original location is deleted, the images will be broken in Document360.\n\nA lightweight text-to-HTML conversion tool used to format content such as lists, headers, images, videos, and links.

When you directly update a heading, both the heading link and name are updated. However, to change the heading without affecting the heading link, you need to update the HTML tag for the heading ID.\n\nTypically, an H2 heading is formatted as `<h2>Heading name</h2>`. To separate the heading link from the name, you can modify the tag as `<h2><a name=\"heading-link\"></a>Heading name</h2>`.\n\n> For example, you want to update the H2 heading name 'How Risk Analytics Works' to 'Risk Analytics'\n>\n> * Your current heading tag would be `<h2>How Risk Analytics Works</h2>`\n> * Replace it with `<h2><a name=\"How-Risk-Analytics-Works\"></a>How Risk Analytics Works</h2>`  \n>    Heading link - `How-Risk-Analytics-Works`  \n>    Heading name - `How Risk Analytics Works`\n> * Now change the heading name to Risking analytics, and don't change the heading link  \n>   `<h2><a name=\"How-Risk-Analytics-Works\"></a>Risk Analytics</h2>`\n> * If you have added a hyperlink for this heading, it will work fine even after changing the heading name.

When translated to French, those links will redirect to the French versions of the linked articles.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> To avoid broken links in translated articles, ensure that article slugs are consistent across languages.\n\n> For example, if the English article has the slug `/getting-started`, use the same slug for the translated version (e.g., `/getting-started` for German). This will help maintain link consistency. This is because when you add a redirect rule, the hyperlink URL text for English language is `docs/en/article_slug` and for German language is `docs/de/article_slug`.\n\n---\n\n### Types of URLs\n\n#### Absolute path/URL\n\nAn Absolute path/URL includes the entire web address, from the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) to the domain name and the path within the site. It is the complete address required to access a specific webpage, regardless of the site you are currently on. An absolute URL is used when linking to external websites or when you want to specify the full address of a page.\n\n**For example**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/v3/overview/interface`\n\n#### Relative path/URL\n\nA Relative path/URL is a shortened version of the URL that only specifies the location after the domain. It assumes that the link is within the same site and shares the same root domain. The relative path always starts with a forward slash (`/`). It is commonly used for internal links within the same site.\n\nIn Document360, relative paths are used in several places, such as the linking feature in the editor, article redirect rules, tag redirect rules, and the ticket deflector.\n\n**For example**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/v3/overview/interface`\n\nRelative path: `/v3/overview/interface`\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### How do I link to an existing article in my Knowledge base?\n\nHighlight the text you want to link, click on the **Link** () icon in the editor toolbar, type the article name in the search field, select the article, and click **Insert**.\n\n#### Can I link to headings within the same article?\n\nYes, you can link to headings (H2, H3, H4) within the same article using the hyperlink () tool in the editor.\n\n#### Do hyperlinks get auto-updated when I translate an article?\n\nYes, when you translate an article, all hyperlinks in the default language will direct to the respective translated language in the new article.\n\n#### How can I link a new article to another article before it gets published?\n\nYou can link new unpublished articles to other articles before publishing them by following these steps:\n\n1. Hover over the desired text in the editor and click the **Insert link** () icon.\n2. In the **Search & link to existing article** dropdown, enter the name of the new article and select it.\n3. If needed, check the **Open in a new tab**option to have the link open in a new tab.\n4. Once finished, click **Insert**.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Until you publish the linked new article, the link will be in a broken state.\n\n#### Does an article heading hyperlink still work when I change the heading name?\n\nNo, hyperlinks would not work when you change the heading name. For example, if you have added a hyperlink for the H3 heading as “Markdown editor”, and later you change the H3 heading to \"The Markdown editor\", then the hyperlink would not work.\n\nVisit this [link](https://docs.document360.com/docs/linking-to-other-articles#does-an-article-heading-hyperlink-still-work-when-i-change-the-heading-name) to find a workaround.\n\n**Bookmark links**, also known as internal hyperlinks or cross-references, allow readers to navigate to specific sections within the same document or webpage.

For example, if the article title is '`This is a really good content`', the resulting URL would be: `docs.yourcompany.com/[project version]/docs/this-is-really-good-content`.\n\n#### Does changing the article title automatically change the slug?\n\nNo, changing an article’s title does not automatically change the article slug.\n\n#### Is it necessary to apply a redirect rule when changing the slug?\n\nWhile applying a redirect rule is optional, it is recommended to ensure that any links to the old slug remain functional, avoiding broken links.\n\n#### Why use special characters like ä, ö, ü in URLs?\n\nSpecial characters like **ä**, **ö**, and **ü** are often part of words in languages such as German. When creating URLs for knowledge base articles or other web content, using these characters can make the URL:\n\n1. **More intuitive:** The URL reflects the exact title or content of the article, making it easier for users to understand.\n2. **Language-specific:** It preserves the linguistic integrity of terms or phrases specific to a language.\n3. **SEO-friendly:** Search engines can associate the URL more accurately with the content, improving visibility for users searching in that language.\n\nHowever, due to technical encoding requirements, these characters must be properly percent-encoded to function correctly in web links. Always copy URLs from the portal to ensure they work as expected when shared.\n\n#### Why do URLs with special characters (e.g., ä, ö, ü) break when shared?\n\nWhen URLs contain special characters like **ä**, **ö**, or **ü**, they need to be percent-encoded for proper handling in web links. If these characters are not encoded, the URLs may break when shared or accessed, resulting in errors. This behavior is consistent across all browsers and messaging tools.\n\n1. **Copy the URL from the Document360 portal:**  \n   Always copy the URL directly from the **portal** instead of from the browser's address bar.

The read count updates daily and is counted once per day per user.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Time spent varies based on user activity. Multiple clicks on the same article are counted as a single read, while time spent can differ for each session.\n\n* **Views**: Represents the number of unique clicks per browser, counted once per browser per user.\n* **Likes**: Shows the total number of likes received by the article, providing feedback on content relevance.\n* **Dislikes**: Tracks the number of dislikes to help identify areas for improvement.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> All metrics start tracking from the time the article is created.\n\n---\n\n### Navigating to project-wide analytics\n\nClick **Go to Analytics** to access the broader project-level analytics for deeper insights into the entire knowledge base’s performance.\n\n![Update-Screenshot-Article_Analytics](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/Update-Screenshot-Article_Analytics.png)\n\n---\n\n### Validating links in article analytics\n\nThe **Link status** displays the **Total** links within an article, including a breakdown of links that are:\n\n* **Working**: Active and accessible\n* **Broken**: Unreachable or incorrect URLs\n* **Unknown**: Status could not be determined\n* **Ignored**: Links intentionally excluded from validation\n\nThe link validation tool helps you maintain active, reliable links within each article. Here’s how to use it:\n\n1. From the Article Analytics page, locate the **Link Status** metric.\n2. Click **Validate Now** to automatically check the link status.\n3. If any links are broken, identify and copy the link URL.\n4. Update the link or set a redirection rule to guide users to the correct destination.\n\n**Example**: If an article link to external documentation is broken, copy the URL, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Article redirect rules**, and add a new rule.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### How often is the analytics data updated?\n\nData refreshes in real-time, with reads updating daily based on unique user sessions.\n\n#### Why might my read count differ from views?\n\nReads factor in user engagement activities like scrolling and clicking, while views simply count unique browser clicks.\n\n#### Can I use article analytics to improve content engagement?\n\nYes, metrics like Reads, Likes, and Dislikes help you gauge engagement, showing which articles resonate most with your audience.\n\n<a id=\"article-access-control-knowledge-base-site\"></a>",

This makes the crawl easier as the sitemap contains all the URLs of the site.\n\n---\n\n### Restricting a specific search engine from crawling\n\n```\nUser-agent: Bingbot \nDisallow: /\n\n```\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy\n\n> The above Robots.txt file is defined to disallow the Bingbot.\n\n`User-agent: Bingbot` - Specifies the crawler from the Bing search engine.  \n`Disallow: /` - Restricts Bingbot from crawling the site.\n\n---\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n* **Include links** to the most important pages.\n* **Block links** to pages that do not provide any value.\n* Add the sitemap location in the **Robots.txt** file.\n* A Robots.txt file cannot be added twice. Please check the basic guidelines from [Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/create-robots-txt#format_location) documentation for more information.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> A web crawler, also known as a Spider or Spiderbot, is a program or script that automatically navigates the web and collects information about various websites. Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yandex use crawlers to replicate a site's information on their servers.\n>\n> Crawlers open new tabs and scroll through website content, just like a user viewing a webpage. Additionally, crawlers collect data or metadata from the website and other entities (such as links on a page, broken links, sitemaps, and HTML code) and send it to the servers of their respective search engine. Search engines use this recorded information to index search results effectively.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**How do I remove my Document360 project from the Google search index?**\n\nTo exclude the entire project from the Google search index:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** ()> **Knowledge base site** > **Article settings & SEO** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Go to the **SEO** tab and click **Edit** in the `Robots.txt`.\n3.

    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\n### Encountering error while translating an article\n\n**Error:** Unable to connect the Translate API  \nThe error message \"Error occurred: Unable to Connect the Translate API\" appears when attempting to apply machine translation to an article in the editor or from the All articles section. This occurs because the HTML content of the article exceeds the character limit of 50,000 set by the Azure Translation service. Articles with a large number of tables or complex HTML elements are more prone to exceeding this limit, as these elements contribute significantly to the overall character count.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Open the code view of the article you are trying to translate.\n2. Copy the entire HTML content of the article.\n3. Use a character counting tool to determine the total number of characters in the HTML content.\n4. If the character count exceeds 50,000, split the article content into smaller sections and create multiple articles.\n5. Apply machine translation to the smaller articles separately to proceed with the translation.\n\n![Encountering “Error occurred: Unable to connect the Translate API\" message while translating an article.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/ScreenGIF-Troubleshooting_Unable_to_connect_the_Translate_API.gif)\n\n### Latest content in the main language not reflected in secondary languages\n\nUpdates made to the main language will not automatically reflect in other languages. You must manually initiate the translation process using the Machine translation feature.\n\nWhen an article is created in the main language, its structure is automatically replicated in secondary languages, but the content itself is not transferred.\n\n**Steps to resolve:** To update the content in secondary languages, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **All articles** () section in the main language.\n2. Select the article you want to translate into secondary languages.\n3. Click **Machine translation**.\n\n   The **Translate to other languages** panel will appear.\n4. Select the desired languages.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> * The translating article(s) will switch to the Advanced WYSIWYG editor and cannot be reverted.\n> * Articles in New or Draft status in secondary languages will be overwritten by the latest version from the main language.\n\n5. Type **Yes** in the confirmation field and click **Yes** to proceed.\n\n![Translating content from the All articles section in the Knowledge base portal](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_ScreenGIF-Translating_content_from_all_articles_realtime_example.gif)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What languages are supported for machine translation?\n\nMachine translation supports the following languages:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Afrikaans | Dutch | French (Canada) | Korean | Slovenian |\n| Arabic | Dutch (Belgium) | Georgian | Latvian | Spanish |\n| Arabic - Egypt | English | German | Lithuanian | Spanish (Mexican) |\n| Bulgarian | English (Australia) | Greek | Mongolian | Swedish |\n| Chinese | English (UK) | he - עִבְרִית | Norwegian | Thai |\n| Chinese (Simplified, People's Republic of China) | English (US) | Hungarian | Polish | Türkçe |\n| Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan) | Estonian | Icelandic | Portuguese | Ukrainian |\n| Chinese (Traditional) | Filipino | Indonesian | Portuguese (Brazil) | Vietnamese |\n| Czech | Finnish | Italian | Romanian | Русский |\n| Danish | French | Ja - 日本語 | Slovakian |  |\n\n#### Can I manually translate articles instead of using machine translation?\n\nYes, you can manually translate articles using external translation services. Once you have finished translating, you can mark them as translated.\n\n#### Is there a limit on how many articles I can translate at once?\n\nNo, you can translate multiple articles simultaneously as long as you have sufficient machine translation credits.\n\n#### What happens if my article exceeds the character limit for machine translation?\n\nIf an article exceeds the 50,000-character limit, machine translation cannot proceed. To enable translation, reduce the character count. Note that the character count is based on the HTML content, ensuring formatting is preserved across all languages during translation.\n\n#### Can I revert back to the original state after machine translation?\n\nOnce an article is machine translated, you can change its status back to \"Needs translation,\" but the original content is not retained. Be sure to keep a backup of the original content if needed.\n\n#### Are there additional costs for using machine translation?\n\nMachine translation is included in your subscription plan. However, exceeding your character limit will incur additional charges.\n\n#### What happens to articles in other languages when I create a new article in the main language?\n\nWhen you create a new article in the main language, corresponding articles are created in other languages (e.g., German, Spanish) but without content. You will need to translate the content using the Machine translation feature in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n#### What happens when I add a new language to the project?\n\nWhen a new language is added after content has been drafted in the main language, the content from the main language is automatically replicated in the newly added language's articles. To translate these articles, navigate to them and click **Needs translation** to complete the translation.\n\n#### Why are some articles empty in other languages?\n\nIf the desired languages were already added to the project before drafting the article in the main language, the content will not be automatically replicated. You must translate the content manually via **All articles**().\n\n#### How do I delete an article in a specific language without affecting other languages?\n\nWhen you delete an article in any specific language, it will also be deleted in the main language and other languages, as articles are linked across languages.\n\nTo avoid this, you can **hide** the article in that specific language:\n\n1. Navigate to the desired article in that language.\n2. Use the **Hide** () option to ensure it does not appear in the Knowledge base for users in that language.\n\n   This way, the article will remain available in other languages within your project.\n\n#### How do I delete all articles in one specific language without deleting other languages?\n\nIf you want to delete all articles in a specific language but retain the articles in other languages:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings**() > **Knowledge base portal** > **Localization & Workspaces** >**Localization & Workspaces**in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Hover over the desired workspace and click the **Edit**() icon.\n\n   The **Edit workspace** panel will appear.\n3. Navigate to the desired language and click the **More** () icon.\n4. Click **Remove**.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> This action will permanently delete all articles in that desired language across the project. Other languages will remain unaffected.\n\n<a id=\"eddy-ai-trust-page\"></a>",

Here are some best practices to help you craft strong meta descriptions and titles:\n\n#### Best practices for SEO meta descriptions\n\n1. **Keep it concise (around 155-160 characters):** Meta descriptions should be brief yet informative. They are snippets that appear in search engine results, so ensure they’re clear and concise.\n2. **Include relevant keywords:** Incorporate primary and secondary keywords naturally, reflecting the core topic of the article to improve discoverability.\n3. **Align with user intent:** Ensure the meta description answers what your target audience might be looking for. This helps increase click-through rates by attracting the right audience.\n4. **Make it actionable:** Use calls to action like “Learn more,” “Discover,” or “Get started” to encourage users to click on your link.\n5. **Unique for every page:** Ensure every page on your website has a unique meta description to avoid duplicate content issues.\n6. **Avoid keyword stuffing:** Overloading the meta description with too many keywords can make it seem unnatural and may negatively impact SEO.\n\n> **PRO TIP**\n>\n> Focus on clarity and relevance. Even though meta descriptions don’t directly impact rankings, they play a significant role in improving click-through rates.\n\n#### Best practices for SEO titles\n\n1. **Optimal length (50-60 characters):** Keep your title under 60 characters to ensure it doesn’t get cut off in search results.\n2. **Include primary keywords:** The title should include your primary keywords, preferably at the beginning, to improve relevance for search engines.\n3. **Reflect the article’s content:** The title should accurately represent the article’s subject matter to avoid misleading users or increasing bounce rates.\n4. **Make it engaging:** Write compelling titles that spark interest. Use power words or questions to attract user attention.\n5. **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure your title is clear, straightforward, and free from unnecessary repetition of words.\n6. **Brand inclusion (optional):** You can add your brand’s name at the end of the title to improve brand visibility, but only if space allows without truncating essential keywords.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Why is an SEO description generator essential?\n\nUse the SEO description generator to generate the meta descriptions for your articles and category pages effortlessly. This AI (Artificial Intelligence) powered feature will generate the best meta description for your articles and category pages based on the content.\n\n#### What is a meta/SEO description?\n\nA meta description or SEO description summarizes an article/category page.

The following elements are excluded when generating tags:\n\n* HTML tags\n* Images\n* URL/links\n* Code blocks\n\nFor example, if your article shows 80 words at the bottom of the Document360 editor, this number includes HTML tags, links, and code blocks. After preprocessing, the word count might be reduced. Ensure the preprocessed article contains more than 50 words to generate tags.\n\n---\n\n**Why is tagging important?**  \nAdding tags to your articles is essential for effective content management, especially when dealing with a large volume of information. Tags categorize articles based on themes or topics, making them easier to locate through searches. Proper tagging improves search precision, enhances content discoverability, and ensures that related articles are grouped together, benefiting both your internal team and external users.\n\n---",

Consistency is key to making sure similar content is grouped appropriately. For instance, decide in advance whether to tag articles based on topics, products, or user roles and follow this approach throughout.\n2. **Use specific and relevant tags**: Avoid broad or vague tags that don't provide enough context. Focus on tags that directly relate to the article's core content. For example, instead of using a general tag like \"Update,\" specify \"Security Update\" or \"Feature Update.\"\n3. **Limit the number of tags**: While tags are important, applying too many can be counterproductive. Aim to use 3-5 key tags per article that best describe the content. This keeps searches focused and avoids cluttering the tagging system.\n4. **Review and update tags regularly**: As your content evolves, review and update your tags to ensure they remain relevant. Retire or modify tags that are outdated or no longer applicable to ensure efficient content retrieval.\n5. **Group content using tags**: Tags allow you to group related content, improving navigation. For example, you could tag all articles related to \"Onboarding,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" or \"Product Features\" to create clusters of related content, helping users easily find what they need.\n6. **Leverage the AI tag recommender**: Use the AI Tag Recommender feature to ensure consistent and relevant tagging across your articles. The AI's suggestions will help maintain uniformity, which is especially useful when different team members are managing content.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Who can generate the Tags?\n\nTeam accounts with the following permission combinations can generate the tags:\n\n* Update article settings + Manage Tags\n* Publish article + Manage Tags\n* Update article settings + Publish article + Manage Tags\n\n#### Can I generate the tags for multiple articles in one go?\n\nCurrently, you can generate the tags for one article at a time.\n\n#### Does using the AI tag recommender feature spend credits?\n\nNo, the AI tag recommender feature does not consume any Eddy AI credits. This feature currently offers unlimited usage without any credit limitations.\n\n#### Can I still add the Tags manually?\n\nYes, you can add the Tags manually.\n\n#### Can I turn off the Tag recommendations?\n\nNo, you cannot turn off the Tag recommendations.\n\n<a id=\"ai-related-articles-recommender\"></a>",

    "heading": "How to write GenAI friendly content",
    "text": "## How to write GenAI friendly content\n\nTo write AI-friendly content for your articles, it's important to structure your information in a way that improves clarity, readability, and searchability. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n### 1. **Use clear and concise headings**\n\n* **Headings (H1, H2, H3)**: Organize content using clear and descriptive headings. This helps AI understand the hierarchy and structure of your article.\n* **Keyword-rich headings**: Ensure your headings reflect the content of the section. For example, instead of \"Introduction,\" use \"Introduction to Cloud Storage Solutions.\"\n\n### 2. **Write short and focused paragraphs**\n\n* **Keep sentences short**: Aim for sentences of 15-20 words. Avoid complex sentences as they can confuse AI processing.\n* **One idea per paragraph**: Ensure each paragraph covers one idea to make it easy for AI to extract key information.\n\n### 3. **Include tables for structured data**\n\n* **Well-labeled tables**: Use tables to present structured data, making it easier for AI to scan and interpret. Clearly label rows and columns with descriptive headers.\n* **Consistent formatting**: Ensure the table is formatted consistently for better AI recognition (e.g., avoid merged cells or irregular formatting).\n\n### 4. **Incorporate code snippets carefully**\n\n* **Use clean and well-commented code**: When including code snippets, use standard formatting and comment on key sections. AI can use comments to understand the context.\n* **Use appropriate syntax highlighting**: This helps AI differentiate code from regular text.\n\n### 5. **Use bullet points and numbered lists**\n\n* **Break up information**: Bullet points and lists help organize content and make it easier for AI to break down and extract key points.\n* **Limit list length**: Keep lists concise, ideally under 5-7 points, to avoid overwhelming the AI and readers.\n\n### 6. **Include descriptive alt text for images**\n\n**Alt text and captions**: Always include descriptive alt text and captions for images. This allows AI to understand and process the context of the image.\n\n### 7. **Provide clear, contextual links**\n\n* **Internal links**: Link to relevant internal articles using clear anchor text. Avoid generic phrases like “click here.”\n* **Anchor text**: Use descriptive anchor text that informs AI of the linked content, such as “Read more about cloud storage security best practices.”\n\n### 8. **Ensure SEO best practices**\n\n* **Keyword optimization**: Use keywords naturally within headings, subheadings, and content. Avoid keyword stuffing.\n* **Meta descriptions**: Write clear, relevant meta descriptions with keywords to help AI rank the content effectively.\n\n### 9. Use business glossary terms consistently\n\n* **Consistent terminology:** Make sure to use terms from your business glossary consistently throughout your articles. This helps AI identify and relate key terms across your content, improving searchability and comprehension.\n* **Define key terms:** If a term might be unfamiliar to readers, include a brief definition or link to your business glossary. This ensures both AI and users understand the context of specialized terms.\n* **Standardize abbreviations:** Always use standardized abbreviations or acronyms from your business glossary. This ensures AI correctly identifies and categorizes key terms.\n\n### 10. **Write for humans first**\n\n* **Conversational tone**: AI tends to perform better with content that is written in a human-friendly tone, as it improves engagement and contextual understanding.\n* **Natural language**: Use natural, everyday language. Avoid jargon or overly complex terms unless absolutely necessary, and provide definitions for technical terms.\n\n### 11. **Monitor AI-generated content**\n\n**Review and revise**: If you're using AI tools like AI writers or content generators, always review the output to ensure it meets your quality standards and reads naturally.\n\n---\n\n#### Recommendations for optimizing your experience as a contributor with Eddy AI\n\nWriting documentation that is easily understood by AI (Eddy AI) involves incorporating clear language, structured formatting, and adherence to specific guidelines.\n\n1. **Use clear and focused language**\n\n   Express ideas in a straightforward manner, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n   Break down complex concepts into simpler, digestible parts.\n\n   Define technical terms or provide links to detailed explanations.\n2. **Structured formatting**\n\n   Use clear headings and subheadings to organize information.\n\n   Employ bullet points and numbered lists to present step-by-step instructions.\n\n   Highlight key points using bold or italics for better parsing by bots.\n3. **Consistent terminology**\n\n   Maintain consistency in the use of terminology to facilitate understanding.\n\n   Use the Glossary feature in Document360 to achieve this.\n\n   Avoid ambiguity by using specific and standardized terms.\n4. **Avoid jargon overload**\n\n   Minimize the use of industry-specific jargon unless essential.\n\n   If technical terms are necessary, provide brief explanations or context.\n5. **Elaborative text content**\n\n   Elaborate the content and clearly specify the content's intent.\n\n   If you use multimedia content, ensure that you provide a text explanation of what the media is trying to convey.\n\n   Break down information into shorter paragraphs for better readability.\n\n   Provide explicit answers to questions in the form of FAQs to minimize inaccurate answers by \"Eddy AI.\" AI bots tend to hallucinate when the content is not elaborate or explicitly mentioned.\n6. **Provide context and example**\n\n   Offer real-world examples to illustrate technical concepts.\n\n   Provide context to help the reader understand the purpose and application of the information.\n7. **Use descriptive headings**\n\n   Craft descriptive headings that accurately represent the content.\n\n   Headings should act as a guide, summarizing the content beneath.\n\n   Avoid repetitive heading text in the same article.\n8. **Test with \"Eddy AI\"**\n\n   Utilize \"Eddy AI\" to analyze your content for clarity and coherence.\n\n   Make adjustments based on feedback from these tools.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can create and manage documentation that is not only comprehensible to humans but also easily processed and understood by AI and NLP bots like \"Eddy AI\".\n\n<a id=\"prompt-engineering-tips\"></a>",

Your existing content remains unaffected.\n\n#### Is the template I create available for other team members to use?\n\nOnce you create or save an article as a template, other team members can view and use the template in the Template library.\n\n#### Does updating a template affect the article created from it?\n\nUpdating a template does not affect articles that were created from that template. When you create an article from a template, a local copy of the content is saved in the article. It is isolated from the template content.\n\n#### Can I clone templates used in articles to other languages?\n\nNo, templates cannot be cloned to different languages in Document360. Currently, templates can only be cloned within the same language.  \nIf you need to use a template in a different language:\n\n1. Manually recreate the template in the desired language by copying its structure and content.\n2. Translate the content into the desired language.\n3.

A **Variable** in Document360 is a reusable element that helps maintain consistency and efficiency across various documentation sections. By employing variables, contributors to your articles can easily update information in one place, and it automatically reflects throughout the entire documentation, ensuring accuracy and reducing redundant efforts.\n\nFor example, you want to add your contact information in multiple instances, which might change over time. In this case, you can add a variable for contact information.

Navigate to the desired glossary and click **Edit** ().\n2. In the editor section, click the **Code view** () icon.\n3. Add the hyperlink in HTML format as shown below.\n\n```\n<p><a href=\"https://google.com/\">Google</a></p>\n```\n\nHTML\n\nCopy\n\n4.

Once the team reviews and addresses the feedback, they mark it as **Complete** to show the work is done. However, if the user later reports that the issue isn't fully resolved, the team can change the status from **Complete** back to **Open** to continue working on it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the feedback is not in scope or the team finishes all related actions, such as updating the documentation and informing the user, they mark the feedback as **Closed**. Once feedback is **Closed**, it cannot be reopened for further changes.\n\n**Can I export the data from the Feedback manager?**\n\nYes, you can export data from the feedback from the Feedback manager for a maximum of up to 90 days.\n\n<a id=\"custom-pages\"></a>",

They are snippets that appear in search engine results, so ensure they’re clear and concise.\n2. **Include relevant keywords:** Incorporate primary and secondary keywords naturally, reflecting the core topic of the article to improve discoverability.\n3. **Align with user intent:** Ensure the meta description answers what your target audience might be looking for. This helps increase click-through rates by attracting the right audience.\n4. **Make it actionable:** Use calls to action like “Learn more,” “Discover,” or “Get started” to encourage users to click on your link.\n5. **Unique for every page:** Ensure every page on your website has a unique meta description to avoid duplicate content issues.\n6. **Avoid keyword stuffing:** Overloading the meta description with too many keywords can make it seem unnatural and may negatively impact SEO.\n\n#### Best practices for SEO titles\n\n1. **Optimal length (50-60 characters):** Keep your title under 60 characters to ensure it doesn’t get cut off in search results.\n2. **Include primary keywords:** The title should include your primary keywords, preferably at the beginning, to improve relevance for search engines.\n3. **Reflect the article’s content:** The title should accurately represent the article’s subject matter to avoid misleading users or increasing bounce rates.\n4. **Make it engaging:** Write compelling titles that spark interest. Use power words or questions to attract user attention.\n5. **Avoid redundancy:** Ensure your title is clear, straightforward, and free from unnecessary repetition of words.\n6. **Brand inclusion (optional):** You can add your brand’s name at the end of the title to improve brand visibility, but only if space allows without truncating essential keywords.\n\n<a id=\"export-documentation-as-zip\"></a>",

All imported data will be added to this new workspace.\n\nImporting the ZIP file does not affect your project’s settings. Be sure to back up any important data before proceeding with the import.\n\n#### What happens if I import a ZIP file into the same project it was exported from?\n\nIf you import a ZIP file into the same project from which it was exported, any articles in the ZIP file that match existing articles in the project will be overwritten with the version from the ZIP file. Articles that do not exist in the ZIP file will remain unchanged.\n\n#### How do I find the Workspace slug URL for my project?\n\n1. Navigate to the desired **Document360** project.\n2. Go to **Settings**() > **Knowledge base portal** > **Localization & Workspaces**.\n3. In the **Localization & Workspaces** tab, hover over the desired workspace and click the **Edit**() icon.\n\n   The **Edit workspace** panel will appear.\n4. In the **Slug URL** field, locate the slug URL for the workspace.\n\n#### Can I import only ZIP files for Document360 projects? Are ZIP files from other platforms supported?\n\nNo, ZIP files from other platforms are not supported. Only project export ZIP files generated in **Document360** can be used while importing content to a project.\n\n#### What is the maximum size for Document360 project ZIP files I can upload?\n\n**Document360** project ZIP files can be uploaded up to a maximum size of 1 GB.\n\n#### Why did my Document360 export file fail to import?\n\nThere are several reasons why your **Document360** export file may fail to import:\n\n1. **Unsupported features**  \n   If the export file contains workspaces, languages, or other features not supported in your current Document360 plan, the upload will fail. Hover over the info icon for details on unsupported features.\n2. **Mismatched slugs and workspace names**  \n   The workspace names and slugs in the source and destination projects do not match. Ensure these align before attempting the upload.\n3. **Incorrect file format**  \n   The imported file must follow the required format for the import process. Verify the structure and ensure it meets the necessary guidelines.\n4. **Missing languages in destination**  \n   If the import file contains languages that are not available in the destination workspace, the upload will not proceed. Add the required languages to the destination workspace before uploading.\n\n![Screenshot-Updated_importing_document360_successfull](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot-Import_zip_file_error.png)\n\n<a id=\"migrating-documentation-from-another-knowledge-base-platform\"></a>",

We can migrate from pretty much any existing knowledge base system or platform.\n\n### Step 2: Migrate\n\nThe migration team then uses automated tools and manual processes to migrate your knowledge base. This will be an iterative process with regular updates and sync-ups.\n\n### Step 3: Test\n\nWe perform a thorough QA (Quality Assurance) process, set redirection rules, and make sure your new Document360 knowledge base is live without losing any of your existing SEO (Search Engine Optimization) traffic.\n\n### To set up a redirect rule for the subfolder URL path\n\nWhen you migrate from another platform to Document360, you must set up a redirect rule at the subfolder level. This will enable any URLs from your previous platform to redirect to documentation in your current knowledge base in Document360.\n\nFollow the below steps to set up a redirect rule for the subfolder URL path:\n\n1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Article redirect rules** > **New redirect**.\n2. Select Redirect type as **Replace with**.\n3. Enter the old subfolder path in the **Source path** field.\n4. Enter the subfolder path you want to redirect in the **Destination URL** field.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n> **For example**, you want to redirect the subfolder path `/help/customer/` to `/docs/en/` in the URLs `https://docs.churn360.com/help/customer/article_slug`.\n>\n> * Enter `/help/customer/` in the **Source path** field.\n> * Enter `/docs/en/` in the Destination URL field.\n>\n> With the above redirect rule, all the URLs with subfolder path `/help/customer/` in the configured knowledge base domain (`https://docs.churn360.com/`) will be redirected to the subfolder path `/docs/en`.\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\n\n**Why should I set up a redirect rule when I change the subfolder path?**\n\nYour readers would have bookmarked the articles in your old knowledge base. Your articles would be backlinked in internal and external articles as references. So, when you do not set up a redirect rule for these URLs, it will lead to a 404 error page. 404 error pages play a negative role in google search index which will pull down google search results and mainly cause a bad reader experience.\n\n<a id=\"pdf-design-templates\"></a>",

Total views, total reads, total likes and total dislikes here in this section are cumulative metrics which include the total including the deleted articles.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Total articles** | Total number of unique articles that were published in the date range based on the applied filters. The deleted articles are not considered. |\n| **Total views** | The number of times an article is accessed is counted once per browser session.   * A view is recorded when an article loads in the browser, regardless of user interaction. * Multiple visits to the same article within a session count as one view, even across tabs or windows or when a user closes and opens the same article within that particular browser session. * Alternatively, if a user opens the same article in a different browser, device, clears the cache & reopens the article or refreshes the browser, they will count as another view. * A browser session resets every 24 hours. Accessing the article after this period will count as another view. |\n| **Total reads** | An article read is recorded when a user engages through clicking, scrolling, and spending time on the page. The user has to perform all these three actions to count as one read.   * **Scrolling**: At least a single scroll is needed for a valid read. * **Time spent**: Time is tracked only after 40 seconds spent on the article. If a user becomes idle (e.g., stops interacting) for some time or switches tabs, the timer pauses and resumes upon return. * **Session tracking**: Time spent revisiting the same article within 24 hours in the same browser session is added to the previous session's total.   Reads reflect meaningful interaction, distinguishing them from simple page loads. |\n| **Total likes** | The total number of likes an article has received. |\n| **Total dislikes** | The total number of dislikes received. |\n\nThe aggregated data for **Views**, **Reads**, **Likes**, and **Dislikes** within the selected date range is presented in both a numeric format and graphs.

In contrast, the Top articles section lists the top 5 most viewed and read articles on your knowledge base, consolidated for the selected period.\n\n#### **Which team account roles in Document360 can access the Analytics section? Is it limited to Admins and Owners?**\n\nIn Document360, Admins, Owners, and Contributors can access the Analytics section if their content role is Editor or draft writer.\n\nIf you want to restrict team accounts from accessing the Analytics section, you can create a custom portal and content role and uncheck the \"Analytics\" permission. This will prevent specific users from accessing Analytics.\n\nWhen creating a new team account or modifying an existing one, assign this custom content role to ensure users with this role can't access the Analytics section.\n\n> For more details on creating a custom content role, read the [Roles and permissions](/help/docs/roles) article.\n\n#### **How can I find the file size I am trying to export?**\n\nCurrently, Document360 does not display the file size before export. After downloading the file, you can check the size on your local device.\n\n#### How does the analytics track read counts for smaller articles that do not require scrolling?\n\nFor shorter articles where scrolling is not necessary, a read is counted if a user clicks on the article and spends at least 60 seconds engaging with the content. Even without scrolling, this interaction is recognized as a valid read based on the read time shown in the article.\n\nA chart legend represents data series in a chart, using colors or symbols to differentiate them.

Accessing the article after this period will count as another view. |\n| **Reads** | An article read is recorded when a user engages through scrolling, clicking, or spending time on the page.The user has to perform all these three actions to count as one read.   * **Scrolling**: At least a single scroll is needed for a valid read. * **Time spent**: Time is tracked only after 40 seconds spent on the article. If a user becomes idle (e.g., stops interacting) for some time or switches tabs, the timer pauses and resumes upon return. * **Session tracking**: Time spent revisiting the same article within 24 hours in the same browser session is added to the previous session's total.   Reads reflect meaningful interaction, distinguishing them from simple page loads. |\n| **Last login** | Displays the login date of the reader’s most recent login.

If a request exceeds this limit, the system may flag the link as **Unknown** or **Broken**. Even if the link is functional, it may be incorrectly marked as broken due to the timeout restriction.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Manually check the URL**\n\n   1. Open the link in a browser to confirm if it loads correctly.\n   2. If the page loads, the link may have been incorrectly flagged as broken.\n2. **Validate the link using Postman**\n\n   3. Open Postman and create a new request tab.\n   4. Enter the URL and select the **GET** method.\n   5. Click **Send** to check the response status.\n3. **Interpret the HTTP response status**\n\n   6. If the response is **200 OK**, the link is functional.\n   7. If the response code is anything other than **200**, the link might be broken.\n\n![Postman interface showing a GET request with highlighted parameters and response status.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/Screenshot-Troubleshooting_Link_status_validation_.png)\n\nSome of the important status codes are:\n\n| **Status code** | **Status description** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **200 OK** | Success | The request was successful, and the expected response was returned. |\n| **201 Created** | Resource created | The request was successful, and a new resource was created. |\n| **204 No content** | No response body | The request was successful, but there is no response body (common for DELETE requests). |\n| **400 Bad request** | Invalid request | The request has incorrect syntax or missing parameters. |\n| **401 Unauthorized** | Authentication required | The request lacks valid authentication credentials (e.g., missing or incorrect API key). |\n| **403 Forbidden** | Access denied | The request is valid, but the user does not have permission to access the resource. |\n| **404 Not found** | Resource missing | The requested resource does not exist or the endpoint is incorrect. |\n| **405 Method not allowed** | Invalid method | The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) is not allowed for this endpoint. |\n| **500 Internal server error** | Server issue | A generic error indicating something went wrong on the server. |\n| **502 Bad gateway** | Invalid response | The server received an invalid response from an upstream server. |\n| **503 Service unavailable** | Server overloaded | The server is down or overloaded with requests. |\n| **504 Gateway timeout** | Timeout error | The server did not receive a response from another service in time. |\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### What is the purpose of the Links status feature in Document360?\n\nThe Links status feature is a broken link checker that helps validate and monitor all internal, external, and media file links on the knowledge base, improving SEO and reader experience.\n\n#### What happens when a user exceeds the Manual validation limit?\n\nWhen you exceed the validation limit as per your plan, the **Validate links** button will be disabled. The manual validation resets on the first day of every month, and the button is enabled again. You can contact our customer support if you need to increase this limit.\n\n#### How can I prevent specific example links from being flagged as broken in the link status report?\n\nIf you have examples or placeholder links in your articles that are being detected as broken links in the analytics, you can exclude these links from validation to avoid confusion.\n\n1. Navigate to **Analytics** () > **Link status**.\n2. On the **Link status** page, click **Manage links** in the top-right corner.\n3. In the **Manage links** page, by default, the **All links** tab will be selected.\n4. Select the links you want to **ignore** from the list or use the search bar to find them.\n5. Once you have selected the desired links, click **Ignore** ().\n\n   The ignored links will be moved to the Ignored tab and will no longer appear in link validation reports.\n\nIf you want to include these links back in the validation process later:\n\n1. Go to the **Ignored** tab.\n2. Select the links you wish to include again.\n3. Click **Include** (), and these links will be validated in future link checks.\n\nThe platform where project members manage and create content for the knowledge base.

When users begin filling out the ticket form, the system suggests helpful articles that might answer their questions, deflecting the need to raise a support request.\n\n#### How does the ticket deflector work?\n\nThe ticket deflector suggests relevant knowledge base articles based on keywords from the user's query or question. As users type into the form, the system automatically searches the knowledge base and displays suggested articles that may provide the solution, potentially preventing ticket submission.\n\n#### What does the ‘*Answered from Knowledge Base’* metric represent?\n\nThe Answered from Knowledge Base metric shows the number of queries that were successfully resolved by the suggested articles in your knowledge base, without the user needing to submit a ticket. This helps measure the effectiveness of your knowledge base in reducing support requests.\n\n#### How can I improve the effectiveness of the ticket deflector?\n\nTo improve the effectiveness of the ticket deflector:\n\n* Ensure your knowledge base is up to date with accurate and comprehensive articles.\n* Use clear and relevant keywords in your articles to improve searchability.\n* Regularly review and update the **Frequently selected questions** section to better address common user queries.\n* Analyze the **Search Success Rate** to identify gaps in your knowledge base and add or improve articles accordingly.\n\n#### How is the Search success rate calculated?\n\nThe **Search Success Rate** represents the percentage of searches that returned a relevant article for the user's query. It compares the total number of searches performed with the number of successful searches that resulted in the user finding a helpful article.\n\nA chart legend represents data series in a chart, using colors or symbols to differentiate them.

The `?` makes the protocol optional.\n\n  > NOTE\n  >\n  > Ensure to add a backward slash (\\) before every forward slash (/) while testing your URL on https://regex101.com.\n* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain name, including letters, numbers, dots (`.`), and hyphens (`-`).\n* `/[a-zA-Z0-9/._-]*?`: Matches the path after the domain, allowing slashes, alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, and hyphens.\n* `?[a-zA-Z0-9=&._-]*?`: Matches optional query parameters (e.g., `?key=value`), making this part optional.\n* `#[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*?`: Matches the fragment (e.g., `#section`), which is also optional.\n\n---\n\n### Examples of URL mapping using Regex\n\n#### **Mapping URLs with specific paths**\n\nTo map a URL pattern like `/users/{id}`, use:\n\n```\n^/users/[0-9]+$\n```\n\nPlain text\n\nCopy\n\nThis captures a user ID dynamically.\n\n**Example Matches**\n\n* `/users/123`\n* `/users/456`\n\n#### **Mapping URLs with query parameters**\n\nFor URLs like `/search?q={query}`, the regex would be:\n\n```\n^/search?q=[a-zA-Z0-9]+$\n```\n\nRegex\n\nCopy\n\n**Example Matches**\n\n* `/search?q=apple`\n* `/search?q=123abc`\n\n#### **Mapping URLs with optional parameters**\n\nFor a URL pattern like `/products/{category}/{id}`, where category is optional:\n\n```\n^/products/[a-zA-Z]+?/[0-9]+$\n```\n\nRegex\n\nCopy\n\n**Example Matches**\n\n* `/products/123`\n* `/products/electronics/123`\n\n#### **Mapping URLs with wildcard or multiple paths**\n\nFor `/blog/*`:\n\n```\n^/blog/.*?$\n```\n\nRegex\n\nCopy\n\n**Example Matches**\n\n* `/blog`\n* `/blog/how-to-code`\n* `/blog/2021/10`\n\n**Mapping URLs with subdomains**  \nFor subdomain URLs:\n\n```\n^https?://?[a-zA-Z0-9-]+.example.com$\n```\n\nRegex\n\nCopy\n\n**Example Matches**\n\n* `http://blog.example.com`\n* `https://shop.example.com`\n\n#### Combining multiple components\n\nTo handle more complex URL mappings, you can combine the various components as needed. The comprehensive regex that matches a URL with an optional protocol, domain, path, query parameters, and fragment looks like this:\n\n```\n^https?://?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9/._-]*??[a-zA-Z0-9=&._-]*?#[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*?$\n```\n\nRegex\n\nCopy\n\n---",

    "heading": "How to change the default widget icon?",
    "text": "## How to change the default widget icon?\n\nYou can easily replace the default Knowledge Base widget icon with a custom one that fits your brand’s design. This gives a more cohesive look to your website or app.\n\n### **Creating a custom button**\n\nTo add a custom button that interacts with the Knowledge Base widget:\n\n1. Add a new HTML element, a button, for example, anywhere on your page.\n\n   ```\n    <button id=\"doc360_help_btn\" class=\"btn hide\"><span>Help!</span></button>\n   ```\n\n   XML\n\n   Copy\n2. Assign the element a CSS class that includes `display: none`.\n\n   ```\n   .hide\n   {\n       display:none;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   CSS\n\n   Copy\n\n### **Setting up callback functions**\n\nTo control the visibility of the custom button based on the Knowledge Base widget’s state, you’ll need to create callback functions in JavaScript.\n\nAdd the following [callback functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function) to any of your JavaScript files or inside a `<script>` tag.\n\n**Show button when widget loads:**\n\n```\nfunction doc360_callback()\n{\t\n    document.getElementById('doc360_help_btn').classList.remove('hide');\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n**Show button after being hidden by URL mapping:**\n\n`doc360_callback` needs to remove the `display: none` from your button. This will be executed when the Knowledge Base widget has completed loading the setting.\n\n```\nfunction doc360_show_callback()\n{\n    document.getElementById('doc360_help_btn').classList.remove('hide');\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n**Hide button based on URL mapping:**\n\n`doc360_show_callback()` needs to remove the `display: none` from your button. This will be executed if the button was previously hidden by URL mapping\n\n```\nfunction doc360_hide_callback()\n{\n    document.getElementById('doc360_help_btn').classList.add('hide');\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n`doc360_hide_callback()`needs to add the `display: none` to your button. This will be executed by [URL mapping](/help/docs/url-mapping) if a valid map is found to hide Knowledge Base widget. These functions handle the button's visibility based on the Knowledge Base widget’s state or URL mapping.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The show and hide callbacks are only necessary if you’re hiding the widget on specific pages using URL mapping.\n\n### Integrating the callback functions\n\nTo make the widget recognize your custom callbacks, modify the Knowledge Base widget’s JavaScript snippet (found in the widget settings):\n\n```\n<!-- Document360 Knowledge Base assistant Start -->\n<script>\n    (function (w,d,s,o,f,js,fjs) {\n        w['JS-assistant']=o;w[o] = w[o] || function () { (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments) };\n        js = d.createElement(s), fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n        js.id = o; js.src = f; js.async = 1; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n    }(window, document, 'script', 'mw', 'https://cdn.document360.io/static/js/assistant.js'));\n    mw('init', { apiKey: 'YOUR KEY', \n                   callback:  doc360_callback, \n                   show_callback: doc360_show_callback,  \n                   hide_callback: doc360_hide_callback });\n</script>\n<!-- Document360 Knowledge Base assistant End -->\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n### **Making the button open the widget**\n\nOnce the button is visible, you’ll want it to open the Knowledge Base widget when clicked. You can achieve this with either pure JavaScript or jQuery.\n\n**Using Pure JavaScript:**\n\n```\ndocument.getElementById('doc360_help_btn').addEventListener('click', function () { \n    document.getElementById('document360-assistant-iframe').contentDocument.getElementById('doc360-button').click();\n});\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n**Using jQuery:**\n\n```\n$('#doc360_help_btn').click(function() {\n    $('#document360-assistant-iframe').contents().find('#doc360-button').click();\n}); \n```\n\nJavaScript\n\nCopy\n\n### **Customizing the button’s appearance**\n\nApply any custom CSS to the button to match your website’s branding. This could involve changing colors, font styles, or adding additional effects.\n\n---",

What is regex?\n\nRegex, short for \"regular expression,\" is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern used to match and manipulate text strings.\n\n> For example, you can use regex to configure a single URL mapping for 20 articles with similar URLs.  \n>  For instance, consider a scenario where you wish to configure URL mapping for the following articles with the base URL '`https://example.com/docs/drive`':\n>\n> * `https://example.com/drive-General`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-settings`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionA`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionB`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionC`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionD`\n> * `https://example.com/drive-functionE`\n>\n> Without regex, you would need to add individual URL mappings for each URL. However, by enabling regex, you can add with a single URL mapping: Select the \"Include path\" option and add `docs/drive` in the URL field. You can use regex to have a more efficient and streamlined mapping process.\n\n---\n\n#### 15. Can I add URL mapping for categories?\n\nYes, you can add URL mapping for categories. It applies only to page and index categories.\n\n---\n\n#### 16. How to remove the Knowledge base widget icon from an article?\n\n1.

    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides step-by-step guidance to address common challenges that you may encounter while managing or accessing your knowledge base site. From website accessibility problems to configuration errors, each solution is tailored to help you quickly identify and resolve potential roadblocks.\n\n### Website fails to load after entering the URL\n\nIf a website is not accessible when you enter a URL, possible causes could be incorrect URL entry, browser cache issues, VPN interference, network problems, server downtime, outdated browsers, or incorrect system date and time settings.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Ensure the website URL is entered correctly.\n2. Reload the page.\n3. Clear browser cache:\n\n   1. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** to open the developer tools menu.\n   2. Right-click the browser's reload button and choose **Hard reload** or **Empty cache**and **Hard reload**.\n4. Check if a VPN is active on your device. Disable the VPN and attempt to access the site again.\n5. Ensure your system's date, time, and time zone are set correctly.\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, consider contacting the support team for further assistance.\n\n### 504 gateway timeout while accessing the site\n\n**Error:** 504 gateway timeout\n\nIf a 504 error occurs while accessing the site, one possible reason could be the sub-folder configuration.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Check recent changes in the web server configuration:\n\n   1. Review the location blocks or configuration files in the webserver for any recent changes.\n   2. If changes are identified, revert them to their previous state.\n2. Verify the sub-folder Configuration:\n\n   1. A change in the sub-folder slug within the Sub-folder Configuration may cause the issue.\n   2. Revert any recent changes to the sub-folder configuration to resolve the issue.\n\n   For more reference on sub-folder configuration, refer to the article on [Hosting Document360 on a sub-directory](https://docs.document360.com/docs/document360-on-a-sub-folder).\n\n### Page unresponsive while editing an article\n\n**Error:** The page isn’t working. example.com redirected you too many times. ERR\\_TOO\\_MANY\\_REDIRECTS.\n\nIf you encounter this error during article editing, possible causes could be an outdated browser cache, overly large articles causing performance issues, missing or improperly closed HTML tags, or excessive redirects due to incorrect configurations in the article.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Clear browser cache:** An outdated or corrupted browser cache can interfere with page functionality. Clear the cache, reload the browser and check if the issue persists.\n2. **Reduce article length:** Large articles with extensive content can cause performance issues. Consider splitting lengthy articles into smaller sections and organizing them under relevant categories to enhance responsiveness.\n3. **Check for missing closed tags:** Ensure all HTML tags in your article have corresponding closing tags, especially in Markdown. Elements like `<table>`, `<div>`, and `<p>` should be properly closed to prevent rendering problems.\n\nThese steps can improve your editing experience and help prevent **Page unresponsive** errors.\n\n### Page isn’t working due to too many redirect**s**\n\n**Error:** Page isn’t working: page redirected too many times\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect JWT Login URL configuration, using the domain URL as the Login URL causing redirect loops, or outdated settings in the JWT configuration.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Check recent changes**: Review any recent updates made to the JWT Login URL in the configuration.\n2. **Correct the Login URL**: Ensure the domain URL is not set as the Login URL. Using the domain URL can cause multiple redirect issues.\n3. **Update JWT configuration**: Remove the incorrect Login URL from the JWT configuration and replace it with the correct one.\n\nFor detailed instructions on configuring JWT, refer to the [JWT article](https://docs.document360.com/docs/configuring-the-jwt-sso).\n\n### Sorry! Project not found during custom domain configuration\n\n**Error:** Sorry! This project does not exist.\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect or missing CNAME record configuration, expired CNAME records in the DNS, or incomplete domain verification in the Document360 portal.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Verify CNAME Record**: Ensure the CNAME record is added correctly and click the 'Verify' button on the custom domain page in the Document360 portal. Once verified, the custom domain will be set up and active immediately.\n2. **Check for CNAME Expiry**: If the CNAME record was updated in the DNS after some time, it may have expired, preventing domain verification and resulting in the error message.\n3. **Reconfigure the Domain**: Reconfigure the custom domain, update the CNAME record, and verify the domain in Document360.\n\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the [custom domain mapping article](https://docs.document360.com/docs/custom-domain-mapping).\n\n### Encountering \"/home/error/\" message while accessing the site\n\n**Error:** /home/error/\n\nPossible causes of this error include incorrect site configuration, server-side issues, or unresolved errors in the website's backend. You might encounter this error in the URL section after the domain URL.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Contact support**: Reach out to us at [**support@document360.com**](mailto:support@document360.com) with the following details:\n\n   1. A screen share video demonstrating the issue on the page.\n   2. Steps to reproduce the error, if possible.\n2. **Provide HAR file**: Follow the steps outlined in this[guide](https://docs.document360.com/docs/document360-support-generating-a-har-file) to download the har file.\n3. **Share console errors**:\n\n   1. After downloading the har file, click on the ‘console’ tab in your browser's developer tools.\n   2. Take a screenshot of the console errors displayed and include it in your email.\n\n### Icons not rendering correctly on the user site\n\nIn some cases, icons on the user site may not render correctly, especially when there are a large number of icons for different navigations. The primary reason for broken icons is an unintended modification of the FontAwesome family provided by Document360. This occurs when changes to other classes or HTML tags on the user site unintentionally alter the icon font settings.  \nTo avoid this issue,\n\n* Ensure that changes to the site's styling or class definitions do not impact the FontAwesome classes or font family settings.\n* When targeting specific elements, double-check that icon-related styles remain intact and are not overwritten.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n**1. Inspect the broken icon:**\n\n1. Use your browser’s developer tools to inspect the user site.\n2. Click the broken icon using the selector tool to identify the issue.\n\n2. **Check custom CSS:**\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Review any font rules applied to various classes. In some cases, font changes may unintentionally apply to broader classes, affecting the icons.\n3. Ensure font changes are applied only to the specific classes that require them. This will help preserve the default settings for Font Awesome and prevent any unintended impact on icons.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### Knowledge base site loading without CSS styling\n\nThis issue typically occurs when the site is accessed from a network where Document360 domains are blocked or not whitelisted by your company or organization.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Verify if the site works correctly when accessed from a different network. If it does, the issue is likely related to network restrictions.\n2. To resolve this, whitelist the following domains in your network settings to ensure proper access and functionality.\n\n![Image showing domains to whitelist to address troubleshooting](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_ScreenShot-troubleshooting.png)\n\n### Secure connection issues on the knowledge base site\n\n**Error:**\n\n* This site can’t provide a secure connection\n* Your connection isn’t private\n* The connection for this site is not secure\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. **Check the CAA Record in DNS:**\n\n   1. Verify if a CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) record is added for your knowledge base site in the DNS records.\n   2. If no CAA record is found, inspect the SSL certificate used for the site. Refer to the steps in the provided video for guidance.\n\n2. **Update the CAA Record:**\n\n   1. Based on the SSL certificate provider, add the corresponding CAA record to your DNS.\n   2. For example, if the certificate provider is Let’s Encrypt, add the second CAA record as specified in the instructions. Similarly, ensure the correct CAA record is added for your certificate type.\n\n3. **Reference for CAA Records:**\n\n   Learn more about CAA records and their importance by reviewing the following article:  \n   [CAA Record and Why It Is Needed (SSL-Related)](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9991/38/caa-record-and-why-it-is-needed-ssl-related/#caa_how).\n\n4. **Contact the DNS Provider:**\n\n   If the issue persists during custom domain setup, reach out to your DNS provider to confirm if there are any additional issues.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### Encountering \"ResourceNotFound\" error while accessing the images, files or attachments\n\n**Error**: ResourceNotFound\n\nThis error occurs when the SaaS token is not appended to the file URL in **private** and **mixed projects**. Document360 appends a SaaS token to ensure that only authorized users can access the file.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n* Ensure the SaaS token is appended to the file URL before accessing or sharing the file.\n* Try downloading the file again directly from Document360.\n\n![Error message indicating resource not found in XML file format.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1739344746842.png)\n\n### Encountering \"AuthenticationFailed\" error while accessing images, files, or attachments\n\n**Error:** AuthenticationFailed\n\nThis error occurs when the **SaaS token** has expired in **private** and **mixed projects**. In Document360, the SaaS token is valid for **15 minutes** before it automatically updates. If a file with an expired SaaS token is shared, users will not be able to access it. Possible causes includes:\n\n1. **Restricted access to Private projects or content**\n\n   Files in private projects or private content within mixed-visibility projects are restricted to users who do not have the necessary permissions.\n2. **SaaS Token expiry**\n\n   * Document360 files use **SaaS tokens** appended to their URLs for **temporary access**. Once the token expires, users cannot access the file.\n   * Expiry time varies based on file type:\n\n     + **Standard files:** The SaaS token expires **15 minutes** from the time the link is generated.\n     + **Video files:** SaaS token expires **after 1 hour**.\n\n> Example SaaS token:\n>\n> https://cdn.document360.io/4214231-3333-4222-huafgesu/exp/PaygOps-2024-Oct-29-03-54-19.zip?sv=2023-12-05&spr=https&st=2024-12-02T04%3A22%3A08Z&se=2024-12-02T04%3A52%3A08Z&sr=c&sp=r&sig=BtPheGpDGeLzQWNyv02oxWqWxvn%2FHwef05UCGJ6RsgHU%3D\n\n**Steps to resolve**\n\n* **Refresh the source webpage** and generate a new file link.\n* Ensure you share the file within the valid token period (15 minutes for standard files, 1 hour for video files) to prevent expiration.\n\n![Error message indicating authentication failure with details about the request and signature.](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/Screenshot-Troubleshooting-Authentication%20failed.png)\n\n<a id=\"customize-site\"></a>",

Instead of displaying a generic error message, you can direct the user to a custom-designed page that includes your brand logo, brief information about the error, and suggested next steps—such as navigating back to the homepage or contacting support. This ensures users remain engaged and informed while interacting with your Knowledge base site.\n\n---",

Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   The **Customize site** page holds all the basic site design configurations.\n2. Click the **Customize site**.\n3. From the left dropdown menu, select the desired error page:\n\n   * [404](/help/docs/404-page)\n   * [Access denied](/help/docs/access-denied-page)\n   * [Unauthorized](/help/docs/unauthorized-page)\n   * [IP restriction](/help/docs/ip-restriction-page)\n4.

If they attempt to access a confidential section reserved for admins, the **Access denied** page will appear, informing them they lack the required permission.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**Can I upload images from my local storage for error page design?**\n\nYes, you can import images from your drive or local storage.\n\n**Why are the Access denied and Unauthorized error pages disabled for my project?**\n\nThese error pages are only available for Private or Mixed access projects.\n\n**Can I add video or GIF elements to the error page design?**\n\nYes, you can add Screen GIFs and video elements to the error page design.\n\n**Is it possible to switch back to the default static page after configuring a error page?**\n\nNo, once you configure a error page, you cannot switch back to the default static page.\n\n<a id=\"404-page\"></a>",

Change the subfolder path back to the default **“docs”** and save the changes.\n* **Redirection rule:** A redirection rule might be misconfigured, either redirecting the article incorrectly or causing a 404 error.\n\n  1. Go to **Settings** () > **Article redirect rules** and check for any rules applied to the article.\n  2. Validate and remove unnecessary or misconfigured rules.\n* **Incorrect URL:** The URL was mistyped or linked incorrectly. Ensure the article slug is in all lowercase letters.\n\n  **Server issues:** A server problem prevented the page from loading.\n\n#### **What are the best practices to create a 404 page?**\n\nThe best practices for creating a 404 page are:\n\n1. **Keep the design consistent**\n\n* Ensure the 404 page matches the overall look and feel of your website or product.\n* Use the same branding, colors, and fonts to create a seamless experience and avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Use clear and friendly language**\n\n* Avoid overly technical jargon. Use simple, friendly language that lets users know they’re in the right place but the page is unavailable.\n* Acknowledge the error with a human touch.\n\n3. **Offer helpful navigation**\n\n* Provide clear links to guide users back on track:\n\n  + **Homepage**\n  + **Search bar**\n  + **Popular or recommended pages**\n* Consider offering links to **frequently visited sections**, like support, contact, or a knowledge base.\n\n4. **Add a search bar**\n\nGive users the chance to search for what they were trying to find. A well-placed search bar can help them continue their journey seamlessly.\n\n5. **Explain what might have happened**\n\n* Include a short explanation of why the user may have ended up there (e.g., broken link, outdated URL).\n* Keep it light and user-friendly: \"It’s possible the page has been moved or no longer exists.\"\n\n6. **Include a Call-to-Action (CTA)**\n\n* Suggest actions they can take:\n\n  + **Contact support** for help.\n  + **Report the broken link**.\n* For an e-commerce site, offering product recommendations or deals could also be beneficial.\n\n7. **Add a touch of humor or personality**\n\n* Inject some personality with humor or visuals. A light-hearted approach can ease the frustration of hitting an error.\n* Use quirky messaging like: \"Looks like this page is on vacation!\" or visual elements like an illustration.\n\n8. **Make the page functional**\n\n* Ensure any buttons or links on the 404 page are working properly and are easy to locate.\n* Double-check that navigation back to the homepage or other sections is smooth and intuitive.\n\n9. **Add a feedback option**\n\nProvide a link or form to report the issue or give feedback. This can help identify any broken links or common user issues.\n\n10. **Consider SEO**\n\n* Include proper meta tags and an SEO-friendly 404 page that informs search engines of the missing page.\n* Include relevant internal links so search engines can still index your important pages.\n\n11. **Use an eye-catching image or animation**\n\n* Visuals can make the 404 page engaging. You can use custom illustrations, fun animations, or even GIFs to add interest and reduce frustration.\n\n12. **Ensure it’s mobile-friendly**\n\n* Make sure your 404 page is responsive and works well on mobile devices, just like the rest of your site.\n\n<a id=\"access-denied-page\"></a>",

This is because SPAs refresh only the article content, not the entire page.\n\nBelow are the areas where users can inject Custom JavaScript within the Document360 portal:\n\n1. **Custom JavaScript**\n\n   Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. **Custom HTML Integrations**  \n   Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Integrations** > **Custom HTML** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n**Recommended solution**\n\nTo ensure compatibility with the SPA model, update your custom JavaScript to use the `articleload` event. This event triggers when the article content refreshes, ensuring your scripts work seamlessly in the new architecture.\n\n1. Replace any code that relies on page refresh events with a subscription to the `articleload` event.\n2. Use the following code snippet to adapt your custom scripts:\n\n   ```\n   window.addEventListener('articleload', function() {\n     // Your custom JavaScript code here\n   });\n   ```\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   Copy\n3. Test your updated scripts to confirm they function correctly in the SPA environment.\n\n   If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Can custom .css files be applied in Document360?\n\nYes, Document360 provides you the flexibility to apply custom .css files to tailor the appearance and style of your documentation.\n\n#### If we need to cater to multiple brands, would we require a separate workspace for each brand, or can different styles/style sheets be applied to different projects within a workspace?\n\nIf you manage multiple brands, you can either create separate workspaces within a single project or purchase additional projects for each brand. It’s important to note that any CSS added to the project will be applied universally across all workspaces. However, you still have the flexibility to customize the styling of landing pages and other elements for each workspace individually.\n\n<a id=\"css-snippets\"></a>",

For instance, if you set a rule with the source path `/customer-support` and the destination `/sales-and-support`, this applies only to the default language of the main workspace.\n\n* To apply this rule to another language (e.g., German: `/de/`), create a new rule with the source path `/de/customer-support` and the destination `/de/sales-and-support`.\n* To apply the rule in another workspace (e.g., version 1: `/v1/`), set the source path `/v1/docs/customer-support` and the destination `/v1/docs/sales-and-support`.\n\n---\n\n### Site-level redirect rule\n\nIn the **Article redirect rules** page, you can set a subfolder redirect rule at the site level using the **Replace with** option. This is useful for migrating from another platform or redirecting deprecated workspaces/languages.\n\n> Example: Set a redirect rule for the subfolder `/azure/serverless` to `/data/cloud360` in the URLs like `https://apidocs.serverless360.com/azure/serverless/article_slug`.\n\n---",

They typically result in a 404 error page.a\n\n#### **What is an article slug?**\n\nA slug is the part of a URL that uniquely identifies a specific article/page. It comes after the `/` in your project's root URL.\n\n> **Example**:  \n> **Article URL**: `https://docs.document360.com/docs/why-did-we-build-document360`\n>\n> **Slug**: `/why-did-we-build-document360`\n\n#### **How many redirect rules can I set up in a project?**\n\nYou can set up a maximum of 10,000 redirect rules per project. If you exceed the limit, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@document360.com).\n\n#### **Are there limits for the import redirect rules feature?**\n\nYou can import up to 1,000 redirect rules per day and use the import feature up to five times per day. If you exceed the limit, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@document360.com).\n\n#### **Why is my published article redirecting to another article or leading to a 404 error on the Knowledge base site?**\n\nThis issue may occur due to a **redirection rule** applied to the article's link. A redirection rule can redirect the article to another page or cause a 404 error if it is misconfigured.\n\nTo resolve this:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** ()> **Knowledge base site** > **Article** **redirect** **rules** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Search for the article's slug in the search bar to check for any redirection rules.\n3. If a rule is applied, validate its purpose. If the rule is unnecessary or misconfigured, remove it.\n4. Save the changes and revisit the article to ensure it displays as expected on the Knowledge base site.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n#### **Why do I see the error \"The KB site is redirected too many times when accessed?\"**\n\nThis error occurs due to a redirect loop, often caused by setting the Document360 Knowledge base site URL as the Sign-in URL for JWT authentication. Ensure the Sign-in URL for JWT authentication is not the same as the Document360 KB site URL. Use a dedicated authentication page as the Sign-in URL to avoid redirect loops and resolve the error.\n\n#### **How can we address the issue of 404 errors when we discontinue functionalities that lead to incoming links from sources we cannot control?**\n\nFor discontinued features, to manage 404 errors effectively, create a standard article informing users about the discontinuation of a functionality, which can be used to redirect relevant articles.\n\nFor multiple discontinued functionalities, consider establishing a centralized page that consolidates all related information, ensuring users can easily access updates and reducing the occurrence of dead links.\n\n#### **How do I redirect an article from one page to another using Custom JavaScript?**\n\nTo redirect an article from one page to another using Custom JavaScript, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** in the Knowledge base portal.\n2. Click **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.\n3. Paste the following code in the **JavaScript** tab:\n\n   ```\n   $(document).ready(function() {\n     if(window.location.href==\"source URL\") {\n       window.location.replace(\"destination URL\");\n     }\n   });\n\n   ```\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   Copy\n4. Replace the **source URL** and **destination URL** in the code.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\n#### **Why do I see the error \"Failed to save article redirection rule” while saving a new article redirect?**\n\nThis error occurs when you try to use a destination slug (the target URL path for a redirection) as the source path for another redirection. Once a destination is defined in a redirection rule, it becomes a static target and cannot be reused as a source in a new rule.   \nTo avoid this error, ensure that the destination slug is not used as a source path in any existing or new redirection rules.\n\n#### **How do I write a redirection rule to replace the workspace name in the URL?**\n\nYou can use redirection rules when migrating from a different platform to Document360.\n\n* Old URL structure: `https://docs.document360.com/{oldworkspace}/section/page`\n* New URL structure: `https://docs.document360.com/{newworkspace}/section/page`\n\nThe same domain must be mapped to both platforms for the redirection to work. For example,   \nIf the old workspace is v1 and the new workspace is v2:\n\n| Source | Destination | Rule |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `/v1` | `/` | endswith |\n| `/v1/` | `/v2` | replacewith |\n\nThis rule ensures that all requests pointing to the old workspace v1 are redirected to the new workspace v2.\n\n#### **How can I redirect a specific article/category URL to the homepage of** **my documentation?**\n\nTo redirect a specific URL to the homepage of my documentation, change the destination URL as ‘**/**’.  \nFor example, if you wish to redirect the URL `https://docs.radixdlt.com/docs/welcome` to `https://docs.radixdlt.com` , set the source URL as /docs/welcome and destination URL as ‘**/**’ in the replace with redirection rule.\n\n<a id=\"configuring-the-article-settings\"></a>",

Hiding the search bar in the header of the home page does not affect its appearance on the knowledge base.\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** and select **Customize site**.\n2. Select the **Header & Footer** dropdown and then choose **Home**.\n3. Click on the **Hero section** and select **Search**.\n4. Hover over the **Search** option and click the eye () icon to hide the search bar on the home page.\n\n#### How do I exclude an article from search?\n\nYou can exclude an article from searches within your knowledge base or external search engines. For more information, read the article on [Excluding articles from search engines](https://docs.document360.com/docs/excluding-articles-from-searches).\n\nArticles that have been hidden will not appear in your knowledge base site and, therefore, will not be searchable by your readers.

If you navigate to ****Drive**()** and then return to ****Analytics**()**, your custom date range filter remains applied, ensuring the data view remains relevant.\n2. **Category manager**   \n   Users often expand the category to view subcategories and articles. Remember state retains the category manager’s last position, making it easier to pick up where you left off.\n\n   **Example:** While exploring subcategories in ****Documentation**()**, you expand a category and navigate to ****Analytics**()**. When you return to ****Documentation**()**, the category manager remains expanded in the same position, maintaining your navigation context.\n3. **Workspace dropdown**  \n   For team members working across multiple workspaces, Remember state preserves the selected workspace even when navigating through other sections.\n\n   **Example:** Suppose you are in ****Analytics**()** under the Beta workspace. You switch to workspace V1, explore the ****Drive**()** section, and then return to ****Analytics**()**. With Remember state enabled, you’ll land back in ****Analytics**()** under workspace V1, maintaining your workspace continuity.\n\n<a id=\"team-auditing\"></a>",

For example, you can monitor when a team member adds a new article, updates an existing one, or changes settings in the knowledge base portal. This feature helps ensure accountability, as it logs who performed each action and when, making it easy to trace specific activities, such as restoring an article that was mistakenly deleted or reviewing changes made during a product release.\n\nThe **Audit configuration** feature allows you to selectively monitor key actions across your project, helping you stay informed without tracking unnecessary data. This feature is especially useful in projects that require oversight of sensitive information or strict compliance.\n\nFor example, a project manager wants to monitor when new articles are published or existing articles are updated, so they turn on the audit configuration for **Documentation editor** events only.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> Only the **Owner**, **Admin**, and users with a **custom role** who have access to team auditing can view and update the team auditing feature.\n\n---",

Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base portal** > **Team auditing** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   By default, **Team auditing** tab will be selected.\n2. In the **Activity by user** dropdown, select the desired team account and click **Apply**.\n3. In the **Event** dropdown, choose the required events and click **Apply**.\n4. In the **Audit date** dropdown, choose the date range.\n\n   The audit data for the selected team account will be listed.\n5. Click **Export CSV** to download the data as a CSV file.\n\n**How frequently is the audit data updated?**\n\nAudit data is updated in real-time. You can click the Refresh button to ensure you are viewing the latest activities.\n\n**Can I view actions performed by specific team accounts?**\n\nYes, you can filter the audit data to view actions performed by specific team accounts.\n\n**Can I restrict access to team auditing data for certain team members?**\n\nYes, access to team auditing can be restricted based on user roles and permissions within the Document360 project.\n\n**Can I recover deleted articles or content through team auditing?**\n\nTeam auditing only tracks actions taken, it does not provide recovery options. To recover deleted content, refer to the Document360 [backup and restore](/help/docs/backup-restore) or [version history](/help/docs/revision-history) features.\n\n**Can I monitor specific events instead of all project-related events?**\n\nYes, turn on the toggle for specific event categories to monitor only those events.\n\n**Can I track changes made to the knowledge base site settings?**\n\nYes, you can monitor site-specific activities like custom CSS updates, enabling cookie consent, etc.\n\n**Is it possible to track actions related to Drive activities?**\n\nYes, you can monitor Drive-related activities such as folder additions, deletions, and file updates.\n\n**Why is the article creation event missing or showing the old name in Team auditing after a Word import?**\n\nIf the article name is manually updated during the Word import process, this change will not be captured in the Team auditing, and the original name of the Word file will be reflected. To ensure the correct article name is reflected in auditing logs, avoid renaming the article during the import process. Instead, rename it after the import is complete.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n<a id=\"localization-getting-started\"></a>",

    "text": "## Localization - Getting started\n\n**Plans supporting localization settings in Knowledge base portal**\n\n| Professional | Business | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nLocalization is the process of transforming and translating the content, look, and feel of a product or service to a specific market or locale. In most cases, the audience is classified based on language, region, or more. In reality, localization is a business's key to unlocking an entirely new revenue center and widening its brand reach in the global market.\n\n---\n\nHaving a global clientele for your business necessitates having a localized language website and knowledge base. This would eliminate many obstacles that your customers encounter when interacting with a single-language website for support.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> * Localization will be available in all plans. You can also purchase additional languages localization as an add-on.\n> * In Document360, if you have a default language of your knowledge base as English, you can also add support articles in a few other languages, like Spanish and Japanese.\n> * The reader would choose to switch between the different languages using a dropdown at the top right section of your page.\n> * If you have translated the articles in the respective languages by manual or machine translation, upon selection, the support articles will be displayed in the chosen languages.\n\n### Complete localization\n\nA localized Document360 knowledge base would  constitute the respective language's specific functionalities, articles, and controls. This involves translating the content from the original language and modifying it to better suit the target audience. In addition, the graphics, color, aesthetics, fonts, and images can be customized accordingly.\n\nApart from the content and visual elements, there are other parameters like units of measure, currencies, local formats for addresses, dates, communication addresses, and more.\n\nA fully localized knowledge base resonates with your diverse users by incorporating culturally relevant nuances, making it feel familiar instead of simply using machine translators and replacing the English words with translated text.\n\nA multilingual Document360 knowledge base could automatically detect and load in a customer's preferred language (based on the customer's login location or browser location preferences).\n\n### FAQ(s)\n\n**What is the localization of a knowledge base?**\n\nLocalization of a knowledge base refers to the process of adapting and translating content in your product's documentation to suit the language, culture, and preferences of different target audiences in various regions.\n\n**Why is it important to localize our product's knowledge base?**\n\nLocalizing your knowledge base enhances the user experience by providing content in the user's native language, making it easier for them to understand and use your product. It also demonstrates your commitment to serving a global customer base and reducing the churn rate.\n\n**What content should be localized in a knowledge base?**\n\nTypically, all customer-facing content, including articles, FAQs, user guides, smart bars, cookie consent, controls, and interface text, should be localized to ensure consistency and clarity for users in different regions.\n\n**How do I decide which languages to prioritize for localization?**\n\nDocument360 recommends you prioritize languages based on your customer demographics, market demand, and potential growth opportunities in specific regions. Analyze your customer's data and feedback to make informed decisions.\n\n**Can I use machine translation for knowledge base localization?**\n\nWhile the machine translation tools offered by Document360 can be a starting point, it's recommended to have human translators review and refine the content to ensure accuracy and maintain the intended meaning.\n\n**How do I maintain consistency across localized knowledge base content?**\n\nDocument360 recommends the implementation of style guides, glossaries, and translation memory to maintain consistent terminology and writing conventions across different languages.\n\n**What challenges should I anticipate during knowledge base localization?**\n\nSome challenges include cultural nuances, technical jargon, and context-specific references that may not directly translate. A well-planned localization strategy can help overcome these challenges. You can also use third-party translation integration, such as Crowdin, with your Document360 project.\n\n> For more information, read the article on [Crowdin integrating with Document360](/help/docs/crowdin).\n\n**How often should I update the localized knowledge base content?**\n\nDocument360 recommends you keep localized content up-to-date with the original source content. Regularly review and update translated articles to reflect changes and improvements. Use the \"**Review reminder**\" feature to set up regular notifications.\n\n**Should I use separate knowledge base workspaces for each language or have a single multilingual knowledge base workspace?**\n\nThis depends on your resources and user needs. Document360 recommends the use of a single multilingual knowledge base workspace. It is more manageable, and Document360 offers an array of security and access features for better control and customization.\n\n**How do I measure the success of my knowledge base localization efforts?**\n\nUse metrics like user engagement, performance analytics, geography metrics, support ticket reduction, customer satisfaction, and feedback from users in different regions to evaluate the effectiveness of your knowledge base localization strategy.\n\n<a id=\"setting-up-a-multi-lingual-knowledge-base\"></a>",

A project can contain all of your documentation, making it easy to manage and maintain content in one place. Think of it as the central hub for your knowledge base content, whether you have a single product or multiple offerings.\n\nWithin your Document360 project, you can create one or more workspaces to better organize your documentation based on audience, product lines, or other criteria.\n\nA workspace is essentially a specialized area within your project that can house content for a particular group or use case. For example:\n\n* If you’re managing documentation for a single SaaS product, one workspace may suffice.\n* If you have multiple products or need separate documentation sets for external customers, internal users, and support teams, multiple workspaces can be more efficient.\n\nThe number of workspaces you can create depends on your Document360 plan.\n\n---",

This makes it easier for users to find the information they need.\n* **Better Organization**: You can segment your knowledge base into well-defined areas, making it easier for team members to manage and update content.\n* **Team Collaboration**: With workspaces, your team can collaborate more effectively, assigning peer reviews, tracking updates, and providing feedback within designated areas.\n\n---",

Instead of purchasing separate Document360 projects for each product, you could create a workspace for each product within a single project. This allows you to manage all documentation in one place, but with clear boundaries for each product’s knowledge base.\n\n### Use case 2: Audience-specific documentation\n\nConsider a SaaS product that has different documentation needs for developers, end-users, and administrators. By setting up separate workspaces for each audience, you can ensure that each group accesses content relevant to their role, avoiding confusion and unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Use case 3: Internal and external knowledge bases\n\nIf you’re creating both internal documentation (for your support or development teams) and external documentation (for customers), multiple workspaces make it easy to keep each set of content separate. This structure allows you to control access permissions, ensuring that only designated users can view internal documents while keeping customer-facing content public.\n\n---",

    "text": "## Email domain\n\n**Plans supporting access to email domain settings in the knowledge base portal**\n\n| Professional | Business | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nConfiguring a custom email domain in Document360 allows your organization to send notifications from a branded email address, improving recognition and trust among your readers while reinforcing your branding strategy.\n\nBy default, notification emails are sent from `support@document360.com` to team accounts and readers. To make customer notifications more personalized, you can set up emails to be sent from an address like `support@yourcompany.com`, making it easier for recipients to identify and trust the sender.\n\nTo enable this feature, you’ll need to configure your DNS entries with your provider to point to Document360.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Ensure you have access to a DNS provider such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in), [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.in), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), etc.\n* This custom email domain feature is available only in the **Enterprise plan**.\n\n---\n\n### Configuring a Custom Email domain\n\nTo configure a custom email domain, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** () > **Knowledge base portal** > **Notifications** in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n   By default, the **Notification channels** tab will be selected.\n2. Select the **Email Domain** tab.\n3. In the **Domain name** field, enter your custom email domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).\n4. Click **Add Domain**. This will generate the DNS records needed for configuration.\n\n**Adding DNS records**\n\n5. Open your DNS provider’s website in a separate tab to add the required MX and TXT records.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Ensure you add the DNS records provided by Document360 to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Hostinger). Adding these records will not override existing MX records.\n\n6. Copy the configuration details from the **Setting up your custom email domain** section in Document360 and paste them into your DNS provider’s settings.\n7. Return to the **Email domain** page in Document360.\n8. Select the **I’ve added the records** checkbox, then click **Verify & Save**.\n\n   Once the MX and TXT records are verified, an **Email Domain Verified** message will appear.\n9. After verification, enter your custom sender information:\n\n   1. **Email field:** Enter the desired “From” email address (e.g., `support@yourcompany.com`).\n   2. **Name field:** Enter the sender name (e.g., `Your Company Support`).\n\nAfter setup, emails will be sent from the configured domain with the specified “From” email address and sender name.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Email_domain.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your custom email domain configuration is still inactive after 24 hours, try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that the MX and TXT records were saved on the domain host.\n2. Ensure the MX and TXT information on the domain host matches the records provided by Document360.\n3. If issues persist, delete the records on the domain host and re-add them.\n\nFor further assistance, please contact us at `support@document360.com`.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n**What is the purpose of MX records, and how do they work?**\n\nMX (Mail Exchange) records are DNS entries that route emails sent to your domain to the correct mail servers. They define the mail servers responsible for handling your email and their priority order. For example, if one mail server is unavailable, emails are sent to the next server in line based on priority (a lower number indicates higher priority).\n\n**Example:**  \nIf your domain has the following MX records:\n\n* `10 mail1.example.com`\n* `20 mail2.example.com`\n\nEmails are routed first to `mail1.example.com` and then to `mail2.example.com` if the primary server is down.\n\n**How are TXT records used in email authentication?**\n\nTXT (Text) records are DNS entries that store text-based information linked to a domain. They serve multiple purposes, such as verifying domain ownership, setting up email security policies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, and providing general domain-related information.\n\nExample: **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework), a TXT record specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain, helping to prevent spoofing.\n\n**SPF Example Record:** `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`\n\nBy implementing TXT records, you can protect your domain from phishing, spoofing, and unauthorized email usage.\n\n<a id=\"how-to-use-postman\"></a>",

    "text": "## Configuring a custom domain for Apex domains\n\nWhen configuring a custom domain for Document360, you may want to use your Apex domain (root domain), such as **abc.com** without a subdomain like **www****.** While configuring subdomains is straightforward, configuring Apex domains requires some extra steps, especially regarding DNS records.\n\n**DNS flattening** is a method that allows you to use a **CNAME record** at the Apex (root) domain level, which not all domain registrars support. If your registrar does not support DNS flattening, you won’t be able to add a CNAME record for your Apex domain.\n\n### Configuring Apex Domains\n\nIf your domain registrar doesn't support DNS flattening (for example, GoDaddy), you can opt for a **DNS provider** that does, such as **Cloudflare**. Cloudflare offers free plans that include DNS flattening, enabling you to configure your custom domain for the Apex domain successfully.\n\nFor example, let’s say you're using GoDaddy, which does not support DNS flattening. In this case, switching to a DNS provider like Cloudflare will allow you to add a CNAME record for your Apex domain.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> For more information, read the article on [**CNAME Flatting**](CNAME flattening)from Cloudflare.\n\n### Using a custom SSL certificate\n\nUse the SSL certificate provided by Document360 for your domain to ensure secure connections, as it offers automatic and seamless renewal for a smooth experience. Provide the following details to process your request to install a custom SSL certificate:\n\n* **Common Name (CN)**: The fully qualified domain name for the certificate.\n* **Organization (O)**: The legal name of your organization.\n* **Organizational Unit (OU)**: The department or division within your organization.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The certificate is typically valid for 90 days. You will have to renew the certificate on time and provide us with the updated certificate so we can install it on your domain.\n\n---",

    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\n### Domain verification failed\n\nIf you are having issues verifying your custom domain, ensure that the [**CNAME**](/docs/custom-domain-mapping#cname) matches the domain host.\n\n![7_Screenshot-Troubleshooting_invalid_record](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1729966781926.png)\n\nThere are chances for any other record to be mapped in the place of CNAME (such as AAAA records). This would also cause an error.\n\n**Suggestion**: To view your domain's CNAME, and other DNS information, use [Digwebinterface](https://www.digwebinterface.com/) or [Google's DNS lookup](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/), or any other DNS lookup tool available on the web  \n![9_Screenshot-Troubleshooting_digwebinterface](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/image-1729967027700.png)\n\nNOTE\n\nFor security reasons, some domain registrars can mask/restrict the DNS records from being discovered on the DNS lookup tools. One such example is **Cloudflare**.  \n In such cases, you can contact your domain registrar for more information.\n\nOnce the correct CNAME is mapped; it might take up to 24 hours for successful mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Wait time after DNS records are updated\n\nIf the CNAME match, and the domain verification issue persists, the TTL (Time-To-Live) can be a possible reason.\n\nIf you're updating an existing DNS Record value, it may take time for the configured TTL to reflect globally. If the TTL is set to 3600 for a DNS record; then, it may take up to 1 hour (3600 seconds) to reflect the DNS record value for the DNS Name server globally.\n\n---\n\n### CAA restriction set by the domain registrar\n\nSome domain registrars set a restriction that the SSL certificate should be provisioned by the specific CAs (Certificate Authority).\n\nFor **example**, if a CAA DNS record has a value of 0 issues \"letsencrypt.org\", then only the Let's Encrypt (CA) will be able to generate a certificate for the particular custom domain. Other Certificate Authorities (DigiCert in our case) would see this configuration and would deny generating an SSL certificate.\n\nCheck if you have any CAA records configured in the DNS configuration for the custom domain.\n\n---\n\n### Resolving the “This site can’t be reached” error while accessing the Knowledge base site\n\nWhile accessing the Knowledge base site, you might encounter errors such as “This site can’t be reached”. In such cases, follow the below troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. Verify when the record was configured and confirm whether it was added immediately after receiving the required values.\n2. Ensure propagation has been completed. (DNS records typically take 2-4 hours to propagate, but it is advisable to wait 24 hours for the changes to fully take effect.) If 24 hours have passed, move to the next step.\n3. Use the Google Dig tool to verify the DNS records. Check for any duplicate entries associated with the same hostname.\n\n   a. If duplicate records are found, remove them and test again.\n\n   b. If no duplicates exist, proceed to the next step.\n4. Check the CAA record entries in <https://dnschecker.org/>\n5. If there are any CAA entries for the domain, ensure that CAA entries for our SSL providers are also added.\n6. Our SSL providers are Lets Encrypt, Digicert, and Google.\n7. Add the following CAA records for SSL providers:\n\n   @ IN CAA 0 issue [digicert.com](http://digicert.com)\n\n   @ IN CAA 0 issue [letsencrypt.org](http://letsencrypt.org)\n\n   @ IN CAA 0 issue [pki.goog](http://pki.goog)\n\n---\n\n### Resolving errors such as “Your connection is not private” or “Your connection is not secure” while accessing the Knowledge base site\n\nThis error typically occurs due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Issue: SSL certificate expired**\n\n1. Check if the SSL certificate has expired.\n2. Visit the Knowledge base site and click the **View site information** option in the URL bar.\n3. Click **Connection is secure** to view the SSL certificate details.\n\n**B. If the SSL Certificate has not expired, then try the below troubleshooting steps:**\n\n1. Try accessing the site from a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues.\n2. Disable any website extensions in your browser and check again.\n3. Verify if all users are experiencing the same issue to identify if it is user-specific or system-wide.\n4. Clear your browser cache or switch to another browser, as this often resolves the problem.\n\n**C. VPN connection**\n\n1. Disable your VPN and try accessing the site again:\n2. If disabling the VPN resolves the issue, the VPN might be causing the problem.\n3. Contact your IT team for further assistance.\n\n**D. DNS records issue**\n\nThere may be issues with the DNS resolver if the DNS records have not been updated successfully.\n\n1. Use a DNS checker (e.g., [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/)) to verify the DNS records.\n2. Confirm if all the records have been updated successfully.\n3. If the records are not properly synced, contact your DNS provider or domain registrar to ensure the DNS zone is correctly configured and synced for the domain.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Do I need an SSL certificate to configure a custom domain?\n\nDocument360 automatically provides an SSL certificate for your custom domain when you map it to your project. You do not need to purchase an additional SSL certificate. However, if you prefer to use your own SSL certificate instead of the one provided by Document360, please reach out to our support team at [support@document360.com](mailto:support@document360.com).\n\n#### Will the custom domain URL reflect in the invitation email sent to readers?\n\nYes, if the invitation email is sent to readers after the custom domain has been successfully mapped, the email links will point to the custom domain.\n\n#### What do I do if the CNAME is not verified after updating the DNS?\n\nIf the CNAME is not verified after updating the DNS, you will have to reconfigure your custom domain.\n\n* Remove the current custom domain configuration.\n* Re-add the custom domain and update the CNAME on your DNS.\n* Ensure the CNAME is verified to complete the setup.\n\n#### Can I configure two custom domains for a single Knowledge base site?\n\nNo, it is not possible to configure two custom domains for a single KB site. However, you can set up a redirection from one domain to the other. This way, visitors to the first domain will be redirected to the second domain.\n\n#### Can I set up multiple domains for a single project in Document360?\n\nCurrently, Document360 supports only one custom domain per project.\n\n#### What is a Naked Domain?\n\nA naked domain is a domain that does not include the \"www\" prefix. For example, if the domain is `example.com`, that's a naked domain, whereas `www.example.com` is not.\n\nBy default, most domains will have the \"www\" subdomain, but a naked domain like `yourcompany.com` doesn't include this subdomain.\n\n#### What is a domain registrar?\n\nA **domain registrar** is a company where you purchase and manage your website’s domain name (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains). This is where you'll update the settings for your custom domain to connect it to Document360.\n\n#### What is a CNAME record?\n\nA **CNAME (Canonical Name) record** is a type of DNS setting (DNS, or Domain Name System, is like the internet’s address book, directing users to the right web server). The CNAME connects your custom domain (e.g., `help.yourcompany.com`) to another address, like the default domain provided by Document360. This ensures that when someone types your custom domain, they are taken to your Knowledge base sight.\n\n#### Why do I need to upgrade to the new load balancer?\n\n* It implements SSL offloading, reducing the load on servers, and improving security by handling SSL encryption/decryption at the load balancer level.\n* It includes a web application firewall (WAF) for protection against common web attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.\n* It utilizes dynamic traffic management algorithms for optimal traffic distribution and improved performance.\n\nWe strongly recommend upgrading to this advanced solution for improved security and reliability.\n\n#### Is it possible to create a separate domain for each version of my project?\n\nNo, it is not currently possible to assign separate domains to individual versions. When you create a new version, you can only customize the path within the existing domain.\n\nA Canonical Name record maps a subdomain to its main domain for hosting purposes.\n\nA Canonical Name record maps a subdomain to its main domain for hosting purposes.\n\nA Canonical Name record maps a subdomain to its main domain for hosting purposes.\n\nThe duration, specified in seconds, that a DNS record is cached before the server queries for an updated value.

    "text": "## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides step-by-step guidance to troubleshoot common challenges you may face during the NGINX setup process. From subfolder hosting issues to failed configuration tests, each solution is designed to help you quickly identify and resolve potential roadblocks, ensuring a smooth and efficient server configuration.\n\n### Resolving invalid location directive in NGINX\n\n**Error:** nginx: [emerg] \"location\" directive is not allowed here\n\nThis error occurs when a location directive is placed outside its valid context, such as outside the server block. In NGINX, location blocks must be defined within a server block.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Ensure that the location block is placed correctly within the server block. Refer to the below sample block:\n\n   ```\n   server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name example.com;\n       location /docs {\n           proxy_pass https://example.document360.io/docs;\n           proxy_set_header Host example.document360.io;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n2. To avoid this issue, do not place location directives in the global `http` context or outside the `server` context.\n3. If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### Certbot package availability issue\n\n**Error:** No package Certbot available\n\nThis issue often occurs when the EPEL repository (required for Certbot installation on RHEL-based distributions) is not enabled, or the package manager is unable to locate Certbot on RHEL-based distributions.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Enable the EPEL repository by using the below code:\n\n   ```\n   sudo yum install epel-release\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n2. Update the repository cache and try installing Certbot again by using the below code:\n\n   ```\n   sudo yum install certbot\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n3. Ensure your instance has internet access to fetch the repository files. If the problem persists, verify the repository configuration files in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.\n4. If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### NGINX configuration test issue\n\n**Error:** NGINX configuration test failed\n\nThis issue occurs when there is a syntax error in the NGINX configuration file.\n\n**Steps to resolv**e:\n\n1. Run the configuration test command:\n\n   ```\n   sudo nginx -t\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n2. Review the error message and the line number like the example shown below:\n\n   ```\n   nginx: [emerg] invalid parameter \"proxy_pas\" in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example:22\n   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n3. Open the specified file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example` and fix the configuration issue. For example:\n\n   ```\n   # Incorrect\n   proxy_pas https://example.com;\n\n   # Correct\n   proxy_pass https://example.com;\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n4. Once the configuration issue is fixed, restart NGINX:\n\n   ```\n   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n5. If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n### SSL certificate issue\n\n**Error:** SSL certificate not working\n\nThis issue may occur due to an incorrect NGINX SSL configuration or when there is an issue with the installed certificate. The certificate details such as domain and expiry date might not match the configuration details.\n\n**Steps to resolve:**\n\n1. Verify the certificate files by using the below code:\n\n   ```\n   openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem -text -noout\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n2. Ensure that your configuration matches the certificate details, such as domain and expiry date.\n3. Ensure the NGINX SSL configuration is correct. Refer to the below code as an example:\n\n   ```\n   server {\n       listen 443 ssl;\n       server_name yourdomain.com;\n       \n       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;\n       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n4. Once done, restart NGINX using the below code:\n\n   ```\n   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n   ```\n\n   nginx\n\n   Copy\n5. If the issue persists after following these steps, please contact the Document360 support team for further assistance: [Contact Document360 Support](https://document360.com/support/)\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\n\n**Why is my site home page not available?**\n\nOnce you have designed the project’s home page using the site builder, ensure that you have published it.

The reader always receives the highest privilege from both individual and group settings.\n\nFor example, if a reader is individually set to access only English in workspace 'V2' but is also part of a group that has access to all languages in 'V2', the reader will have access to all languages in 'V2'.\n\n**How is reader access prioritized?**\n\nAccess is determined by the highest privilege assigned at each content level. Readers only gain access to the content they have been specifically granted.\n\n**Why is self-registration not working for my project?**\n\nSelf-registration does not function as expected when SSO (Single Sign-On) is enabled because SSO bypasses the Document360 login page, where self-registration typically occurs.

    "text": "## FAQ(s)\n\n**What is an IP address?**\n\n**IP** address stands for Internet protocol address. It is an identifying number associated with a specific computer or computer network. The IP address allows the computers to send and receive information when connected to the internet.\n\n**What is an IPv4 format?**\n\nAn IPv4 address consists of four numbers, each containing one to three digits, with a single **dot** (.) separating each number or set of digits. The four numbers can range from **0** to **255**.\n\nFor example, 49.206.113.170\n\n**What is an IPv6 format?**\n\nAn IPv6 offers a vastly expanded address space, using 128-bit addresses compared to IPv4's 32-bit, which means it can support an almost unlimited number of unique IP addresses. Usually shown as sequences of hexadecimal digits, separated by a colon ( : ). Each group is up to four hexadecimal digits long, and each address comprises up to eight groups (octet).\n\n> For example, FE38:DCE3:124C:C1A2:BA03:6745:EF1C:683D\n>\n> * **Starting IPv6 Address**: The lowest possible IPv6 address is 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\n> * **Ending IPv6 Address**: The highest possible IPv6 address is ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff\n\n**What is an IPv6 unicast address?**\n\nA unicast address in IPv6 identifies a single network interface among a group of devices. When data is sent to a unicast address, it is explicitly delivered to that intended recipient, ensuring direct point-to-point communication on the network. This contrasts with multicast and anycast addresses, which serve different communication purposes in IPv6.\n\nThe platform where project members manage and create content for the knowledge base.

    "heading": "How does SSO work?",
    "text": "## How does SSO work?\n\nMost websites or web applications like Document360, referred to as **Service providers**, have a dedicated, secure, and centralized database for user information and credentials.\n\nTo facilitate the Single Sign-On feature, an external entity, the **Identity Provider** or **IdP**, is brought in to ease the user experience in accessing the web application by authenticating the user's credentials and authorizing the access to the 'Service provider'.\n\nHere’s a sequential rundown on how the Single Sign-on (SSO) feature works\n\n1. The user visits the intended Service provider or application domain sign-in page\n2. Redirection takes place to the Identity Provider (IdP) login page\n3. The user signs in with the correct credentials\n4. The IdP domain matches the user information and sends an **Access token** or **ID token** to the Service Provider\n5. The validation of the Access/ID token with user information is thriving on the Service provider’s end\n6. A trust relationship is established between the IdP and the Service provider\n\nAs the authentication is successful, the user is now authorized to access SSO-enabled applications within the service provider without the whole process of Signing in for each instance.\n\nDocument360 allows you to configure multiple SSO options simultaneously. This means you can set up single sign-on using various identity providers for your team and readers. For example, you might use one IdP for internal employees and another for external customers or partners. This gives your team and readers the flexibility to choose their preferred IdP for accessing both the knowledge base portal and site.\n\n---",

Please ensure you are using the correct login credentials (non-SSO for non-SSO projects).\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our [support team](https://support.kovai.co/a/tickets/support@document360.com) for further assistance.\n\n#### **Why am I encountering a 500 error when using SSO authentication to access my Knowledge base portal?**\n\nIf SSO authentication is causing a 500 error, it may be due to an outdated SAML certificate. First, check if your site is set to public, as SSO authentication is typically used for secure access. Updating the SAML certificate on your end should resolve the issue.\n\n<a id=\"login-using-sso-knowledge-base-site\"></a>",

Access the discovery document specific to your Identity Provider (IdP) by using the following URL format: `https://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n2. For example, if you're using Auth0, it might look like: `https://your-domain.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n3.

When the end-user tries to access the knowledge base configured with ****JWT****, the Document360 knowledge base will redirect the end-user to the login URL that the team account has configured in **Document360 **JWT** settings.**\n\n   Assuming that the configured login URL resides inside the customer application, which will require authentication.\n2. By calling the login endpoint in the customer application, it will invoke the login logic, which will send a request with:\n\n   * User details\n   * Client ID and client secret to the identity server code generation URL to get the authentication code\n\n     This process is done through the backchannel.\n3. The code generation URL will accept the POST requests with the JSON payload shown below:\n\n   The client ID and secret must be sent as a basic authorization header.\n\nFollow this [**link**](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/) to find out how the header needs to be formed for basic authentication.\n\n#### JSON payload\n\n```\n{\n\"username\": \"firstname + lastname\",\n\"firstName\": \"firstname\",\n\"lastName\": \"lastname\",\n\"emailId\": \"user emailId\",\n\"readerGroupIds\": [\"Obtain from Reader groups overview page in the Document360 portal (Optional)\"],\n\"tokenValidity\": 15 //minutes *()*\n}\n```\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Ensure correct JSON syntax to avoid configuration errors.\n\n4. The identity server will generate the code based on the user details, client ID, and client secret and return the generated code to the customer application.\n\n   This is done via the backchannel.\n5. Once the customer application receives the auth code from the identity server,\n\n   * The customer app will append the code to the callback URL found in the ****JWT** settings** and redirect the user to the callback URL with the code.\n   * **For example:** `HTTPS://{project_name}.document360.io/jwt/authorize?code={code}`\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> The authentication code is a one-time use code and cannot be reused.\n\n4. Once the knowledge base receives the authentication code in the query parameter, it will send the code to the identity server via backchannel for the ID token and access token.\n5. Once the knowledge base has received the ID token, it will create a session on behalf of the user mentioned in the earlier user details.\n\n   * By default, this session will be valid for **15 minutes**. Once the session cookie expires, the end-user will be redirected to the login URL (hosted within the customer application) to get a new code, and the flow will repeat.\n   * The session renewal will be seamless since the user is already authenticated to the customer application\n\n#### Token validity\n\nThe **minimum value** that can be set is **5 minutes**, and the **maximum value** that can be set is **1440 minutes** (1 day).\n\n#### cURL\n\nTo test the JWT configuration, you can use the cURL command with the following specifications. The HTTP version should be specified (**HTTP2** over **TLS** and version of **SSL** to **TLS 1.2**. Without this, the cURL would fail.\n\n> NOTE\n>\n> Unlike other IdP options available (Okta, Azure AD, etc.), the user does not need a separate reader account on Document360. An account on the client application is sufficient.\n\nAfter enabling the JWT login, the reader can use the client application to log in as a reader account on the Document360 knowledge base site.\n\nNOTE\n\nCurrently, Document360 provides an either-or functionality for the SSO standards. Once the IdP is configured using an SSO standard (SAML, OpenID, or JWT) for a project, the user cannot create another simultaneous session.\n\n**For Ex.** If a project is configured in the OpenID standard with Okta as IdP, the SAML and the JWT options would be disabled.\n\n---",

If the request is successful, you should receive an **auth code** or token in the response.\n\n---\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Can I use a single JWT login to support multiple instances of my application on the same Document360 Knowledge base site?\n\nNo, currently, Document360 supports a single JWT login configuration per project.\n\n* A common JWT login cannot be shared across multiple instances of your application for the same Document360 knowledge base.\n* Each project can only authenticate one JWT application instance at a time.\n\n#### If a configured JWT user logs out of the client application, does that mean they would also be logged out of Document360?\n\nNo, the session on Document360 is independent after the initial Single Sign-On. Users can continue using Document360 until the token validity expires, even after logging out of the client application.\n\n**Example:** If the token validity is set to 1 day, the Document360 session will remain active until the token expires. Once it does, the user will be logged out.\n\n#### What are the minimum and the maximum token validity bands?\n\nThe **minimum value** that can be set is **5 minutes**, and the **maximum value** that can be set is **1440 minutes** (1 day).\n\n#### Can I provide a value that exceeds the allowed token validity band?\n\nNo, if a value outside the range is provided, the system will automatically assign the nearest allowed value:\n\n* **5 minutes** for values below the minimum.\n* **1440 minutes** for values above the maximum.\n\n#### What is the difference between JWT and SSO?\n\nYou can view a comparison between JWT (JSON Web Token) and SSO (Single Sign-On) in the table below:\n\n| **Aspect** | **JWT** | **SSO** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Authentication** | Tokens generated per session/user request. | Centralized authentication across apps. |\n| **Token Expiry** | Tokens typically expire after a set period. | No token, session handled by identity provider. |\n| **Security** | Requires secure token storage. | More secure, centralized credential storage. |\n| **Usage** | Used for stateless, single-use authentication. | Used for multiple applications with single login. |\n| **Integration** | Easier to implement in custom apps. | Requires integration with an identity provider. |\n\n#### Can readers log in with OpenID or SAML if JWT is configured for the project?\n\nNo, readers cannot log in with OpenID or SAML if JWT is configured for the project. Document360 allows only one SSO standard (JWT, OpenID, or SAML) to be active per project at a time.\n\n#### What features are not supported when JWT is configured for the project?\n\nThe following functions are not supported when JWT is configured for the project:\n\n1. **Advanced Settings**: Auto-register SSO and skip the Document360 common sign-in page.\n2. **Readers**: Self-registration.\n\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a widely used Single Sign-On (SSO) standard that enables secure authentication and authorization by allowing users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.\n\n<a id=\"jwt-reader-groups\"></a>",

The **minimum value** that can be set is **5 minutes**, and the **maximum value** that can be set is **1440 minutes** (1 day).\n\nTo add multiple group IDs, separate them with commas (`,`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n\"readerGroupIds\": [\"26b3812e-7879-4407-b1c9-5755c32b886a\", \"674eadcd-793f-4131-b1e0-c1f055cc83b7\"]\n```\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\nWhen a JWT reader authenticates and accesses the private knowledge base, the restrictions defined in their assigned reader group will automatically apply. This ensures the reader can access only the specific project versions, languages, categories, or articles permitted by the reader group's settings.\n\n### Timing of changes to reader group IDs\n\nChanges to Reader Group IDs (additions or deletions) in the payload will take effect only after the current session (token validity) expires.\n\n**Example**: If the token validity is set to 30 minutes and a new Group ID is added, the change will apply only after 30 minutes. The same applies when removing a group ID.\n\n<a id=\"how-to-enlarge-the-pdf-preview-in-the-article\"></a>",

For enhanced styling or features, you would need to resort to HTML and CSS or use a Markdown processor that allows for custom styles.\n\n<a id=\"how-to-add-extra-space-in-markdown\"></a>",

You can easily create a Scenario (workflows that connect your app): choose a trigger for the workflow to activate and then choose a response action. This opens new possibilities and hundreds of possible use cases.\n\n> Go to **Settings** → **Knowledge base portal** → **Extensions** → **Team collaboration**\n\n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/make-setup-guide)\n\n---",

Article redirect rules\n\n* #### Redirection types\n\nWe have added two types of article redirect\n\n* **Ends with** - To set redirection rule for URL text next to the domain name in the article URL\n\n  > **For example**,  \n  > **Source**: /docs/Installation-guide  \n  >  to  \n  > **Destination**: /docs/Support-guide\n* **Replace with** - To set redirection rule for the URL text between the domain name and article slug\n\n  > **For example**,  \n  > **Source**: /v1/Installation-guide  \n  >  to  \n  > **Destination**: /v3/Installation-guide\n\nTo access the redirect types, go to **Settings → Knowledge base site → Article redirect rules → New redirect rule**(button). Select from either one of the types (Ends with or Replace with).\n\n* #### Import redirect rules\n\nYou can now import redirect rules in bulk on the Article redirect rules page. To access the Import redirect rule, go to **Settings → Knowledge base site → Article redirect rules → Import redirect rule**(button). Choose and add the CSV file with all the sources, destinations, and redirection types.\n\nThe **CSV file** (less than or equal to 1MB) should follow the **Document360 standard import template**, which can be downloaded from the blade window by clicking on the **standard template**. The redirection rules (Source path, Destination path, and Redirection type) would be validated and reported in the blade with the valid and invalid rules available.\n\nA **download** icon can be observed next to Invalid rules, which downloads a spreadsheet with the reason for the Invalid rule.\n\n* #### Filter option\n\nA **Search**, **Modified date**, and **Type** filter have been added to the redirect rule page. This helps you narrow down the rules you are looking for. This option comes in handy for bulk operations such as **Remove** or **Export**.\n\n* #### Export redirect rules\n\nThe **Export** option has been added to the article redirect rules page. The option can be seen at the top-right of the page. The article redirect rules can be filtered using the **Type**(Ends with, Replace with, or Both), **Modified date**, and the **Search** keyword filter. The entire list or the filtered list can be exported as a CSV file onto your local device storage.\n\n* #### Bulk redirect rule remove\n\nThe pagination display 50 redirect rules on a single page. If you click on the **Select all** button, the 50 records available on that page will be selected. If you wish to choose multiple other page records, navigate to the next page and click on the 'Select all' button. Click the **Remove** button at the top.\n\nAs an improvement, we have added more context to the auditing events captured for actions on individual redirect rules. The rule itself would be shown in the redirect rule record.\n\n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/redirecting-article-urls)\n\n### 2. Localization\n\nThere are a couple of enhancements to the localization feature.\n\n* When performing bulk or individual article translate, the content from the latest published article in default language would be translated and overwritten on the selected languages\n* If you have linked any articles in the default language article or any internal article heading link, after translation, the link would be referenced to the selected language article rather than the original link.\n\n  > **For example**, If the article '**Getting started**' in **English** language is linked in another English language article '**Installation support**'. When you translate the article '**Installation support**' to **French**, the hyperlink used to link the '**Getting started**' article would be altered to point to a similar article in the French language.\n\n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/bulk-operations#12-machine-translate)\n\n### 3. Portal search - Articles\n\nWe have added two additional filters in the Full portal search for articles.

Billing\n\n#### Multicurrency support\n\nWe have introduced the multicurrency payment option to help customers avoid additional international transaction fees and currency conversion charges. Choose your convenient currency to pay for your Document360 subscriptions. You can pay your subscription bills in **USD** (United States dollar), **GBP** (Pound sterling), **EUR** (Euro), or **AUD** (Australian dollar).\n\n![3_Screenshot-Pricing_page_trial](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/3_Screenshot-Pricing_page_trial.jpg)\n\n> **For example**, say you own a UK-based credit card, and you want to pay in **USD** instead of **GBP** because it's cheaper based on the currency conversion rate. You can choose USD as your currency, but the bank might impose an additional transaction fee for currency conversion on your credit card.\n\n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/upgrading-from-trial-version)\n\n#### Best practices Add-on\n\nWe have introduced a one-time add-on that provides expert help setting up and managing your knowledge base. Our experts will assist you in configuring your knowledge base and guide you in best practices.  \n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/best-practice-setup-addon)\n\n### 2. Links status\n\nThe link limit has been defined for each pricing tier (For example, the Business tier gets 5000 links). If the limit is exceeded, the validation would only be performed for the available limit (old links would be prioritized, and newer links would be excluded). The extra links that exceed the limit are not validated. Article level validation is also not possible for those links.\n\n> **For example**, your total link limit is 10000, but the total links count in your project is 10500. Only the first 10000 links are validated when you perform the links validation. The recently added 500 links are not validated.\n\nTo validate all the links in your project, contact our support team [**support team**](https://document360.com/contact-us/) to increase the limit.\n\n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/links-status)\n\n### 3.

Custom article status indicator\n\nNow you can add a custom status indicator for your article. This status is visible on the knowledge base site.\n\n> **For example**, you want to show the reader that an article is for a feature in your product that is still in beta-testing. You can add the custom status indicator as **Beta**.\n\n![8_Screenshot-Enabling_custom_status_indicator_1](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot-Enabling_custom_status_indicator_1.png)\n\nThe custom status indicator is enabled by default. You can enable/disable it as per your requirements. Go to **Settings** → **Knowledge base site** → **Article settings & SEO** → **Article settings** (tab) → **Category manager** → **Custom status indicator**.\n\nUse the toggle switch to enable or disable the custom status indicator. Use the background color picker or HEX code to choose any custom color.\n\n![9_Screenshot-Enabling_custom_status_indicator_Localization_variable](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot-Enabling_custom_status_indicator_Localization_variable.png)\n\nTo change the custom status indicator text in the available languages, go to **Setting → Localization & versions → Localization variables → Category manager**.

As a new user you would sign up for Document360, and an activation mail would be sent to the registered email address.\n\nYou can access the portal for the next 24 hours, but it is recommended that you activate your account. Post the 24 hours the activation link sent in the mail should be used and a password should be set to use the portal for the next 14 days. Also, the activation mail earlier had a 24-hour validity which has been removed.\n\n### 2. JWT logout page\n\nEarlier when JWT SSO reader logs out from KB, they would land on the regular Document360 identity logout page. With this new enhancement, any webpage can be set as a logout landing page. This option can be configured on the JWT setup page (\\*\\*Settings→ Security→ Enterprise SSO → JWT→ JWT Basic configuration). Add the custom page link in the **Logout URL**(optional).\n\n![4_Screenshot-JWT_Logout_url_page](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot-JWT_Logout_url_page.png)\n\nIf the custom logout link is not provided, they would land on the new logout page designated for the JWT SSO readers.  \n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/configuring-the-jwt-sso)\n\n### 3.

Custom sizes for the Logo on the Cover  page\n\nEarlier users can upload their logo on the cover page, but the size was predefined. Now with this enhancement, users can select the three standard square sizes available Small(100px), Medium(150px), Large(200px), or choose a custom size in pixels. The canvas size can be between 20 and 300 pixels in both width and height.\n\n![5_Screenshot-Export_to_pdf_design_template_header_image_size](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot-Export_to_pdf_design_template_header_image_size.png)\n\n#### b.

Earlier users had to manually select all the files in the recycle bin one page at a time and use the **Delete forever** option. Now with just the click of the **Empty recycle bin** button, the entire recycle bin can be emptied.\n\n### 2. Export to PDF\n\n#### a.

The preview jumps to the selected option in the generated PDF.\n\n#### c. Live preview\n\nWe have added the live preview option to the design template page. As the user edits the different aspects of the template (For ex. Cover page title) the preview window on the right would also display the changes live.\n\n#### d. Team audit and notifications\n\nEarlier, only the export event was captured in the **Team auditing** section.

Using this nifty feature project team members can define, manage, and track the different phases in the documentation of an article. This serves as a good assistance to editors in keeping track of the article statuses in the knowledge base project.\n\n#### a. Workflow designer\n\nThe **Workflow designer** can be found under the **Documentation** menu grouping in the new **Content tools** menu. ***(Content tools → Documentation → Workflow designer)***\n\n![1_Screenshot-Workflow_designer_page](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Workflow_designer_page.png)\n\nThe stages of the documentation cycle are referred to as **status** in the Document360 workflow. Two default system statuses (**Draft** and **Published**) and one custom status (**In review**) would be available by default.\n\nHowever, users can add custom status based on their requirement, rearrange the order and delete (just custom status). When the status is set as **read only**, other users will not be able to edit inside the documentation since it would be available only in read-view. They can only assign a user and/or assign a due date.\n\n#### b. Workflow assignments\n\nA complete overview of all the documents (articles and category pages) in the selected version and language of the knowledge base project. To access this page, just click on the **Workflow assignments** option above the category manager on the left.\n\n![2_Screenshot-Workflow_assignments](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot-Workflow_assignments.png)\n\nHere, users can view the total document count, Documents that are assigned to the respective user by another team member, the article count in the different statuses, and the article list with filtering options.\n\nUsers can view the current **Workflow status** and the article workflow history at the top left in the documentation editor. By clicking on the dropdown, the user gets the complete information about the past, current, and upcoming article status.\n\n### 2. Ticket deflector in Knowledge base assistant\n\nNow users can map the existing and live ticket deflector forms on the Knowledge base assistant. We introduced the **Ticket deflector** (a feature that helps reduce the volume of support tickets by resolving customer queries with self-service support.) in our July release. And in the past release, we introduced Analytics data for the Ticket deflector forms.\n\nWhen the user has mapped a live ticket deflector, all the form analytics data (such as satisfaction, feedback, answered from KB, search, and form submission) can be viewed. Go to **Analytics → Ticket deflectors** and select the Knowledge base assistant in the **Application** dropdown.\n\nIf any helpdesk (Freshdesk or Zendesk) is configured on a live Ticket deflector form, that configuration would also be available when you add the respective form on the Knowledge base assistant.\n\n### 3. ‘Page not found’ data in Analytics\n\nWe have added an exclusive **Page not found** (**404 error**) section in the Analytics menu. If any visitor access unavailable URLs in your knowledge base, it would be recorded as 'Page not found (in technical terms 404 error). For a healthy knowledge base (and good SEO) this error should be avoided. Users can view the data when such errors occur and resolve it.\n\n![4_Screenshot-Page_not_found_analytics_page](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot-Page_not_found_analytics_page.png)\n\nUsers can also view a drill-down of the **User-agent type** (source) such as **Browser, Bot,** or **Unknown**. Users can view the data for up to 30 days. On the overview page, users can view the list of links that throw the 404 error, User-agent type (Browser, bot, unknown), User agent (For ex. Mozilla 5.0), the timestamp (in UTC), and the URL referrer.\n\n---",

The user doesn’t have to go through the entire process of compiling the articles and categories every time. Instead, they can just click on the **Download** option and the same content set would be exported again.\n\n### 2. Import and Export – Language level\n\nNow export and import project versions at a language level. This feature comes in handy when users want to localize/translate a particular version in their project. Users can make use of the translation capabilities in the knowledge base portal.\n\n![6_Screenshot-Import_and_export_enhancement](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/6_Screenshot-Import_and_export_enhancement.png)\n\nHowever, when they want to translate huge volumes of articles, they can simply export a certain language, translate it, and then import the same file (.zip) back into the Document360 project. The article in the imported file would be saved as a new version if it’s from the same project. If the user imports a file from a different project, new articles would be created for the same.\n\nThis would help users move content from one project to another or have a copy of their knowledge base project as a backup either in markdown or HTML format.\n\n### 3. Drive updates\n\n1. We have capped the file limit to **5000 per folder**. If you have a sub-folder inside a parent folder, that would be treated as a separate folder.\n2. Earlier, uploading files directly from the article editor would be added to the Documentation default folder. Now individual folders in the Drive can be mapped to different categories in the knowledge base. If no folder is selected, the files would be uploaded into the default Documentation folder.  \n    Also, if the sub-category is not mapped to any specific folder in the Drive, then it would be saved under the default ‘Documentation’ folder.\n3. **Set drive folder** – Click on the ••• more option in the top right when a category is selected and click on **Set drive folder**\n\n![7_Screenshot-Drive_improvement_Set_drive_folder](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7_Screenshot-Drive_improvement_Set_drive_folder.png)\n\n4. If the ‘Documentation’ default folder reaches its maximum limit of 5000 files, the next file uploaded or moved would be saved under a newly created default folder ‘Documentation\\_1’\n5. Folder selection can be done now for document elements (Images, Videos) while import of articles from .docx files\n\n### 4. Category page integration\n\n#### a. Links status\n\nCategory page links have been included in the Links status at the time of validations (Scheduled and Manual) and the link overview page. Earlier, the validation would only accommodate article links. The category page links can be distinguished using a category icon next to the link. This applies to the ignored links overview page as well.\n\n![8_Screenshot-Category_link_selection_on_analytis_page](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot-Category_link_selection_on_analytis_page.png)\n\nUsers can easily filter the category page links in the links list by clicking on the quick filter option **Category links** (or) In the filter bar, select **Category links** in the **Source** dropdown.\n\n#### b. Drive dependency viewer\n\nWhen users view the file dependencies in the Dependency viewer blade (***Drive → Select folder → eye icon*** next to any file) the category page dependency would be distinguished using the **Category page** label.\n\n---",

    "text": "## New features\n\n### 1. Ticket deflectors\n\n### Ticket deflectors – Helpdesk configuration\n\nWe have added yet another feature to the Ticket deflectors. Now users can raise support tickets from the Document360 ticket deflectors form directly onto third-party helpdesks like **Freshdesk** or **Zendesk**.\n\nHere’s how you can configure the helpdesk on the ticket deflector. Click on **Settings → Knowledge base site → Ticket deflectors → Notification & Ticket**. On the right when you scroll down you can find the **Helpdesk ticket** section.\n\n![1_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_Helpdesk_configuration_menu](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_Helpdesk_configuration_menu.png)\n\na. To configure Freshdesk, add the **API key** and **Domain URL** obtained from Freshdesk on the Document360 Helpdesk configuration blade.\n\nb. To configure Zendesk, add the **API key**, **Domain URL**, and **Zendesk agents’ Email** obtained from Zendesk on the Document360 Helpdesk configuration blade.\n\n![2_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_Helpdesk_configuration_blade_view](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_Helpdesk_configuration_blade_view.png)\n\nEach time a reader raises a ticket, a replica of the ticket would be recorded on the helpdesk platform you have configured.\n\n### Ticket deflector – Analytics\n\nAnalytic data is now available for the Ticket deflectors. You can access this by clicking on the **Analytics** menu and **Ticket deflector** option.\n\nHere you have access to four sections  \n • Dashboard  \n • Feedback  \n • Satisfaction  \n • Search\n\nEach section gives a distinct drill down into the different analytics data. This data helps to understand the reader, retune the ticket deflector, and address the changes required in the knowledge base.\n\n![5_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_analytics](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot_Ticket_deflector_analytics.png)\n\n---\n\n### 2. JWT\n\nA **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a means of representing claims to be transferred between two applications. JWT is used only for the Readers login.\n\n![3_Screenshot_JWT_login_client_secret_create_JWT](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/3_Screenshot_JWT_login_client_secret_create_JWT.png)\n\nYou can easily create a JWT **(Settings → Advanced → Enterprise SSO → JWT)** which is referred to here as the **Client secret**. You can use this in your application to configure Document360 Enterprise SSO login for your reader. Unlike the other IdP options available (Okta, Azure AD, etc) the user is not required to have a separate reader account on Document360; the account on the client application would do. After the JWT login is enabled, the reader can use the client application credentials to log in to Document360 knowledge base site as well.\n\n![4_Screenshot_JWT_login_client_secret](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot_JWT_login_client_secret.png)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Download article as PDF on Knowledge base site\n\nWe have now introduced the option for readers of your knowledge base site to download individual articles as a PDF. The download **PDF** option would be available on the top left of the article, along with **print** and **share** buttons.\n\n![6_Screenshot_Knowledge_base_site_download_article_as_pdf_button](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/6_Screenshot_Knowledge_base_site_download_article_as_pdf_button.png)\n\nBy default, this option is enabled in your new or existing project. You can disable this by going to **Settings → Knowledge base site → Article settings & SEO → Article settings**. In the **Article header** section, turn **off** the **Show download PDF button** toggle to disable this option for your readers.  \n![7_Screenshot_Knowledge_base_site_download_article_as_pdf_control](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7_Screenshot_Knowledge_base_site_download_article_as_pdf_control.png)\n\n---",

If you are a customer in the Standard plan, you can purchase a version add-on with the available business tier plan versions). This option is available across all the plan tiers.\n\n#### b. Team accounts add-on\n\nThe restrictions for the number of team accounts have been lifted and you can now purchase any number of team accounts on your project irrespective of the plan tier. This option is available across all the plan tiers.\n\n#### c. Downgrade plan by yourself\n\nEarlier, if you wanted to downgrade your project from a higher plan tier to a lower plan tier (For ex. Enterprise → Business) you had to contact customer support on Document360. Now you can do it by yourself in few simple steps by unchecking the option in the downgrade window **(Settings → Billing → My plans → Downgrade)**. The only limitation here is that few dependency features like **Content reuse, Ticket deflector, Custom roles,** and **Enterprise SSO** have to be manually altered or disabled before you can proceed with the downgrade.\n\n![8_Screenshot_Billing_downgrade_scenario](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot_Billing_downgrade_scenario.png)\n\n#### d. Get feature\n\nWe have added the **Get feature** button on the different feature pages in Standard and business tier plans.  You can also view a brief intro on what the feature does and an explainer video on the right. When you click on the **Get feature** button, a billing blade would open with all the feature list, add-ons, and cost information. You can click on the **Confirm payment** button and your plan would be upgraded to an upper tier.\n\n![9_Screenshot_Billing_get_feature](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot_Billing_get_feature.png)\n\n#### e. Feature caps changed\n\nNow you can enjoy the revised cap for API tokens and Article review reminder feature across all the plan tiers. **API token** is set to the max limit of **10** and **Article review reminders** to the max limit of **10**.\n\n### 2. Integration rules (Show/Hide)\n\nYou can now set Show and Hide rules for all the configured third-party integrations in your knowledge base. You can configure the conditions based on **IP address, Project**, and **Language**.\n\nGo to **Settings → Knowledge base site → Integrations** and click on an already configured integration or add a new integration. In the Add integration blade, you can find the **Advanced insertion rules** section. Now choose the **Show** and/or **Hide** rules. Once you’re done, click on the **Add** button at the bottom.\n\n![10_Screenshot_Integration_show_hide_rules](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/10_Screenshot_Integration_show_hide_rules.png)\n\n### 3. Ignored links on Links status\n\nNow we have added a new link type called **Ignored links** along with the working, broken, redirected, and unknown. In this context when you add a link to the Ignored link category, that link will be omitted from all the upcoming scheduled and manual validations. Any team member with access to Links status can Ignore or include links anytime and any number of times on their project.\n\n![12_Screenshot_Link_Analytic_ignored_links_blade](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/12_Screenshot_Link_Analytic_ignored_links_blade.png)\n\n---",

    "text": "## New feature\n\n### 1. Ticket deflector\n\nOptimizing and balancing the role of a knowledge base and customer support in customer query resolution has always been a challenge. The all-new **Ticket deflector** feature does just that, helping customers find the solution before directly raising a ticket with customer support.\n\n![1_Screenshot_Accessing_ticket_deflector_in_settings](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot_Accessing_ticket_deflector_in_settings.png)\n\nTicket deflector achieves this with a bit of reader interaction, a set of questions and responses called **block steps**, and a search assistant. Most customers' query gets resolved in this stage and this, in turn, reduces the number of support ticket significantly.\n\n### 2. Dependency viewer – Drive\n\nOne of the most requested and awaited features in Document360 Drive, the **file dependency viewer** is a part of this release. Now users can view all the reference point articles/category pages where an individual file from the Drive has been added/attached. You can access the viewer in one of two ways on the Drive.\n\n![2_Screenshot_Accessing_file_dependency_viewer_in_drive](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2_Screenshot_Accessing_file_dependency_viewer_in_drive.png)\n\nYou can either select the **View dependency article(s)** option after clicking on ••• button next to the file **(or)** clicking on the **‘eye’ icon** on the right when you hover your mouse pointer over the file.\n\nThis dependency viewer gives you the list of articles/pages the file has been used; along with details such as article name, link to the article, article status, version, language, and the contributor who has used/attached the file.  \n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/file-dependency-viewer)  \n![3_Screenshot_File_dependency_viewer_blade_in_drive](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/3_Screenshot_File_dependency_viewer_blade_in_drive.png)\n\n### 3. Export to PDF\n\nThe Export to pdf feature is not an entirely new feature in the Document360 portal, but we now have a dedicated page with additional settings and a menu item for this added in **Settings** under **Advanced**.\n\n![4_Screenshot_Accessing_export_to_pdf](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot_Accessing_export_to_pdf.png)\n\nWe have added two tabs in the Export to PDF page (**Export** and **Settings**)\n\n#### Export\n\nSelect the published content from your knowledge base such as specific project version, language, with a predefined setting to be exported as a PDF. You can also choose to secure the PDF with password protection.\n\n#### Settings\n\nYou can create and save predefined settings for your future PDF exports. You can customize and modify most of the PDF file attributes (cover page, watermark, page orientation, fonts, TOC, etc.) to better suit your company’s branding or style guide.\n\n![5_Screenshot_export_to_pdf__add_settings](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot_export_to_pdf__add_settings.png)\n\n---",

You can add the **private notes** to your articles/pages by using the respective icon on the formatting toolbar in both markdown and WYSIWYG editor.\n\n![6_Screenshot_Private_notes_configuring_visibility](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/6_Screenshot_Private_notes_configuring_visibility.png)\n\nWe have also added more controls for private notes exclusive to the **WYSIWYG editor**. You can control who can see the private note by configuring the visibility setting. You can enable and select the intended **security groups** and/or **reader groups** to view the private note. You can also leave it at the default setting of **All team accounts** if you want this to be visible to all team members (or) you can toggle to off on all options to not to show the private note to anyone in KB.\n\nNote\n\nAdvanced private note visibility controls are **only available in WYSIWYG editor**.\n\n### 2. Additional text formatting on snippets\n\nUsers can now edit their snippet content using additional tools added onto the formatting toolbar.  \n Previously only basic tools (bold, italic, underline, callouts, table, and code block) were available.  \n Here are some of the new tools added: **Font settings, lists, insert image, links,** and **code view.**  \n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/v3/docs/snippets)  \n![7_Screenshot_Additional_formatting_controls_on_snippets](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7_Screenshot_Additional_formatting_controls_on_snippets.png)\n\n### 3. Mark as deprecated\n\nYou can notice a small change with the text formatting tools now available at the top in the deprecation message field. This was previously available but many of our users failed to notice or use this as it would only be visible when you click inside the deprecation message field.\n\n![8_Screenshot_Mark_as_deprecated_formatting_controls](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot_Mark_as_deprecated_formatting_controls.png)\n\nAnother update to this feature is that now you can select multiple articles to bulk deprecate in the **All content** page.\n\n[**Read more →**](/v3/docs/marking-articles-as-deprecated)\n\n![9_Screenshot_Mark_as_deprecated_in_all_content_bulk](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot_Mark_as_deprecated_in_all_content_bulk.png)\n\n### 4. Custom domain enhancements\n\n* **Sub-domain** names can be directly edited by owners/admins on the knowledge base portal. Earlier you had to contact our customer support for custom domain changes\n* You can now change the default **sub folder hosting path** (/docs) to match your needs. For example /help, /support, etc\n* A new control to enable/disable article preview in sub folder hosting has also been added above the sub folder path setting\n\n***(Settings → Knowledge base site → Custom domain → Custom domain mapping/Sub folder hosting)***\n\n![10_Screenshot_Custom_domain_mapping_enhancement](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/10_Screenshot_Custom_domain_mapping_enhancement.png)\n\n---",

Tag management\n\nWe now have a separate module for all your tag management under a single menu. You can view, add, edit, redirect, and delete tags from this repository. Its so much easier when the same tags use in articles can also be used for files on your Drive. You can also view a dependency view for your tags.

Automatic review reminder\n\nNow you can add automatic review reminder for article/page at a project level. You can set the number of days before the newly published article/category page is up for a review reminder. You can set from 1 to 365 days from the date of publish. You can change this option in ***Settings → Project admin → General → Documentation → Review reminder***.\n\n![3_Screenshot-Default_review_reminder_setting](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/3_Screenshot-Default_review_reminder_setting.jpg)\n\n### 3. Mark as deprecated\n\nEarlier you had the option **‘Mark as deprecated’** (for outdated or obsolete content) at a version level on your project. Now you can use the same function at an article/page level, where in the article/page would appear with the **‘Deprecated’** public status indicator. Also, you can show custom description or reason for the deprecation and the link to a newer version of the article/page at the top.\n\n![4_Screenshot-Mark_as_deprecated_reader_view](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot-Mark_as_deprecated_reader_view.jpg)\n\nYou can access this option under the **Mark as deprecated** section in the right side **article settings** menu.\n\n![5_Screenshot-Mark_as_deprecated_setting_portal_view](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/5_Screenshot-Mark_as_deprecated_setting_portal_view.jpg)\n\n### 4.

As an enhancement to this feature, you have the option of **disabling feedback for individual article/page** in the article settings. At the same time if you have disabled feedback at project level, you cannot enable feedback for individual articles/pages.\n\n![6_Screenshot-Disable_article_level_feedback](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/6_Screenshot-Disable_article_level_feedback.jpg)\n\n### 5. Bulk delete on article/category versions\n\nEarlier you could only delete one article/page version at a time in **view history**. Now you can select multiple versions the article/page has been forked from and do a bulk delete. This action would be logged in your Team audit and a notification would also be sent to the admin/owner.\n\n![8_Screenshot-Article_version_bulk_delete](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot-Article_version_bulk_delete.jpg)\n\n### 6. Filter assistant content\n\nNow you can control and choose what knowledge base content you want to show/hide in your Knowledge base assistant. Earlier all the versions, languages, categories, articles were shown to the readers when you activate the Knowledge base assistant in your project or elsewhere.\n\n![9_Screenshot-Filter_kb_assistant_categories](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot-Filter_kb_assistant_categories.jpg)\n\nGo to ***(Settings → Knowledge base assistant → General → Filter assistant content)***. Here you can choose version level, language level, or even category level restriction of content to access and display on your assistant assistant.\n\n### 7. Content reuse – UI enhancements\n\nWe have brought a quick access button for **Content reuse** in the documentation editor. You can find the new Content reuse button along with the **Templates** and **Bulk operations** button on the left. Also, the UI of the content reuse window has also been improved. You can notice the language selection has been moved on the top as a drop-down.\n\n![10_Screenshot-Content_reuse_UI_revamp](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/10_Screenshot-Content_reuse_UI_revamp.jpg)\n\n### 8.

Regardless of the use cases, article templates provide design consistency and style for your brand.\n\n![1_Screenshot-Article_template](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/1_Screenshot-Article_template.jpg)\n\nIn Document360 you can create new articles from any of the basic system templates or create/save from your own article template, which you can reuse any number of times in your project.

We have added assistants (Most viewed, liked, read, modified, and created) which you can customize on your home page. Also, you can edit and add Language specific SEO titles for your page.\n\n### Selective PDF export\n\nNow you can perform the bulk operation of exporting your intended articles as a PDF file. You can select all or specific articles you want to be compiled and exported using the Generate pdf option.\n\n### Article status indicator\n\nWe have introduced a new status indicator in articles. The newly created articles that haven’t yet been published are indicated in Blue. Also, previously the articles that are being forked would be represented in Yellow & Green will henceforth be indicated in just Yellow. The rest of the status indicators remain the same (Green for published articles and Red for article under review)\n\n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/article-status)\n\n![4_Screenshot-Article_status_indicator_new](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/4_Screenshot-Article_status_indicator_new.jpg)\n\n### Integrations\n\nWe have improved the UI in the Integrations page. Now there are about 21 integrations that can be connected with your Document360 project. Another notable feature is the ability to switch on/off the integration in your project without having to remove or delete the configuration completely.  \n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/integrations-getting-started)\n\n### Machine translate\n\nEarlier articles in the HTML editor (WYSIWYG) could be translated using the Machine translate option. If you wanted to translate an article in Markdown, you had to manually convert/change the editor settings to HTML editor before proceeding with the Translate.\n\nWith the latest improvement the articles created with markdown editor can be automatically changed to HTML when you click on Machine translate.  \n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/machine-translation)\n\n### Drive\n\n* You can now set restrictions for file formats that can be uploaded into the Drive\n* Another minor improvement is with the folder colors. Earlier users can only select from a predefined color palette. But now, we have added the color picker and He code support.\n\n### Table of content\n\nNow you can choose to display even **H3** and **H4** subheadings on the right-side along with table of content in your articles. Earlier the default mode was only for H2 headings. This would give a complete tree-view skeleton of the article.  \n[**Read more →**](https://docs.document360.com/docs/right-sidebar)\n\n### UI/UX improvements\n\nWe have made few UI improvements in the portal.

By offering your brand experience and support in a language that feels familiar, both existing and potential customers are much more likely to engage with your knowledge base content and reduce churn rate.  \n![Image 7 - Screenshot - UI improvement- Language dropdown](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/Image%207%20-%20Screenshot%20-%20UI%20improvement-%20Language%20dropdown.jpg)\n\nLocalizing your Home page and your knowledge base would eliminate many hindrances faced by your customers in understanding and connecting with your business, as opposed to single language website and documentation. The translation of your categories can either be done in-house or external human translators manually, with generic machine translation (MT) option, or on a cloud-based localization management platform ([Crowdin](https://docs.document360.com/docs/en/crowdin)) where machine and human translators can collaborate.\n\n![2 ScreenGIF - Comparison English and Russian](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/2%20ScreenGIF%20-%20Comparison%20English%20and%20Russian.gif)\n\nThere’s much more to gain from [localizing](https://docs.document360.com/docs/en/setting-up-a-multi-lingual-knowledge-base) your Document360 knowledge base than just translated articles. You would be able to customize functionalities, articles, and URL slug in the intended languages. This would mean the content is either just translated from the original language or content is modified to better suit the target audience. The graphics, colors, and the aesthetics of your pages, fonts, and images can also be modified.\n\nAlso read our [Localization blog article](https://document360.com/blog/multilingual-knowledge-base/) for a detailed walk-through of this feature.\n\n### Drive\n\nA new and improved repository for your entire digital assets is here. Sync, organize, backup, and work with your folders and digital file formats like images, videos, audios, documents, and many other formats.\n\nYou can upload your digital assets to [Drive](https://document360.com/blog/manage-knowledge-base-assets-using-the-new-document360-drive/) using the simple interfaces on your Document360 project dashboard. The way the Drive works is like most well-known cloud storage platforms and a no brainer to get used to. Also, your Drive size limit would be based on the monthly plan you’ve chosen.\n\nRead our [Blog article on Drive](https://document360.com/blog/manage-knowledge-base-assets-using-the-new-document360-drive/) for a detailed walk-through of the feature.\n\n![Image 2 - Screenshot - New drive window](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/Image%202%20-%20Screenshot%20-%20New%20drive%20window.jpg)\n\n---",
