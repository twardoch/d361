You can filter articles based on the following workflow statuses: **Draft**, **In review**, or **Published**. If you missed the review due date for any article, it will appear under the **Overdue** category.\n\n![](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/7.1_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_workflow_assignments_page.png)\n\n#### c. Starred\n\nThe Starred section contains the articles you marked as favorites. This allows quick access to important articles.\n\n![Document360's 'Starred' interface showing a list of articles with the respective tags and article status, along with an arrow pointing at 'Starred' on the left navigation panel](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/8_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_starred.png)\n\n#### d. Recycle bin\n\nThe Recycle bin section includes a list of articles and categories deleted in the past 30 days. You can restore the deleted categories and articles in the available time frame.\n\n![Document360's 'Recycle bin' interface showing an empty recycle bin, along with an arrow pointing at 'Recycle bin' on the left navigation panel](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/9_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_recycle_bin.png)\n\n#### e.

Categories & Articles (Category manager)\n\nWriting and publishing articles in Document360 is simple: pick your category, create an article(title and slug), add SEO details, and publish to your knowledge base.\n\nWhen you update or edit an article (Fork), Document360 will create a new Article revision without affecting the live/public workspace.\n\n![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_documentation_view_categories_and_articles.png)\n\nYou can make the necessary changes and republish when you're ready. You can identify the articles easily using the Article status indicators (Yellow dot). Document360 maintains all the workspaces to check the differences between them.\n\n---\n\n### 3. API documentation\n\nThe API documentation feature in Document360 provides a complete solution for creating and managing API references. This feature allows you to create high-quality API documentation that helps users understand and consume your APIs effectively.\n\n![13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/13_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_api_documentation.png)\n\nThis API module includes the **Try it!** feature, which allows the users to test the API endpoints within the Knowledge base site. You can create dedicated versions of your API documentation. The feature provides an intuitive interface for uploading API references as URLs or JSON/YAML files. After uploading the OpenAPI definition, the interactive API endpoint articles are created in the Knowledge base portal. Now, end users can access the **Try it!** option with the available endpoints, parameters, and responses in the API documentation on the Knowledge base site.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Analytics\n\nDocument360 includes an **Analytics** menu with tools to help you understand end-user engagement with your knowledge base.\n\n![12_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Analytics](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/14_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_analytics.png)\n\nHere is the list of metrics and modules you can track with the Analytics tool:\n\n* **Articles**\n* **Eddy AI**\n* **Search**\n* **Team accounts**\n* **Feedback**\n* **Links status**\n* **Page not found**\n* **Ticket deflector**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Widget\n\nThe Knowledge base widget (previously known as *Knowledge base assistant* (or) *In-app assistant*) helps readers find their answers without leaving your site or application.\n\n![8_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Widget](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/15_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_widgets.png)\n\nYou can update the following Knowledge base widget settings from this menu.\n\n* **Installation & setup**\n* **Custom CSS**\n* **Custom JavaScript**\n* **URL mapping**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Drive\n\nCentralized and cloud-based storage for Document360 projects that stores and let team members manage all the Knowledge base artifacts (files). If you have already used any other heavyweights, such as Google Drive or OneDrive, getting accustomed to the functions in Document360 Drive should be relatively easy. You can access your Drive by clicking the Drive icon on the left menu.\n\n![7_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Drive](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/16_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_drive.png)\n\n---\n\n### 7.

Search\n\nA dedicated space to search the entire project content is now available on the Knowledge base portal. Perform a combined search across all the workspaces and languages simultaneously. The search bar is available at the top of all the modules and pages in the Knowledge base portal.\n\n![10_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Search](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/18_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_search.png)\n\nThe search engine works similarly to the other search functionalities in the portal. Type in the keyword and narrow the results using filters such as workspace, language, visibility, tags, and date range. You can preview the article/category page, and then preview the article or navigate to the article in the Editor.\n\n![11_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_Search_results](https://cdn.document360.io/860f9f88-412e-4570-8222-d5bf2f4b7dd1/Images/Documentation/19_Screenshot-Knowledge_base_portal_search_bar_dropdown.png)\n\nAs the search is performed universally in the project, it covers files. Users can switch between the article and Drive search using the tabs below the search bar.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Open site\n\nThe Open site () action is used to navigate to and view the Knowledge base site. Clicking the icon will take you to the Knowledge base site of the workspace that is currently open in your knowledge base portal. If you are in the API documentation workspace, the Open site action will take you to the API documentation home page. If your API documentation site does not have a home page, you will be directed to the first article or category page in the API documentation.\n\n---",
