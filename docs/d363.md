## 257. Troubleshooting

- **Large articles:** Split articles exceeding 50,000 characters (HTML) into smaller sections for translation.
- **Content updates:** Manually trigger updates in secondary languages using the "Machine translation" feature in the "All articles" section. New content doesn't automatically update.
- **Supported languages:** Machine translation supports many languages (list provided).
- **Character limit:** Be mindful of the 50,000 character limit and potential error messages.
- **Reversibility:** Translating changes the article status, but the original content is not recoverable. Backups are recommended.
- **Costs:** Machine translation is included in the subscription, but excessive character counts may incur additional charges.
- **Language management:** Deleting or hiding articles in one language affects the main and other language versions. Changing/Adding languages isn't automatic, requiring specific actions.

## 258. Understanding machine translation with real-time examples

Document360 offers two machine translation methods. **Scenario 1** allows translating existing English articles to other languages (e.g., German, Spanish) via the "All articles" section, requiring selection, confirmation, and automated translation. **Scenario 2** involves adding a new language (e.g., French) post-content creation; English articles are replicated but must be translated manually. If languages were added before content creation, manual translation from "All articles" is needed. The timing of language addition affects content replication and translation requirements.

To manage machine translation credits effectively, start by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > Localization & Workspaces > Machine translation** to monitor your project's usage. The dashboard includes Limit (total credits), Usage (consumed credits), Remaining (leftover credits), and Usage meter (percentage used). Note that individual articles must be under 50,000 characters, including formatting; split larger articles if necessary. Subscription plans determine credit limits: Professional (1M), Business (2M), and Enterprise (5M). Additional credits can be purchased in 1M increments for $50.

Machine translation credits are managed via the settings portal, with metrics for limit, usage, remaining, and usage percentage. Articles must be under 50k characters, including formatting. Subscription tiers set limits (Professional: 1M, Business: 2M, Enterprise: 5M), with options to buy additional 1M credits for $50.

Document360 projects include **System folders** like Images, Settings, and Documentation, marked by a shield icon. These folders are essential, restrictions prevent deletion or renaming, but allow actions like adding files, customizing colors, and setting defaults.

## 344. Adding files

Add files to a drive folder using drag-and-drop (into empty folders) or via the "More" menu. Specify file location, optional tags and alt text (for images). Avoid file names with +, %, #, =. Check supported file types.

To add subfolders, choose between two methods in the Drive section:

1. **Using the 'More' option**:

- Click the More icon next to a folder.
- Select "Add folder," name it, and set its location.

2. **Using the '+' option**:

- Hover between folders until the '+' icon appears.
- Click '+,' name the folder, and set its location.

Ensure root folders are expanded to correctly create subfolders. Deleting a root folder also removes its contents.

## 345. Folder actions in Drive

Organize Drive folders and subfolders logically (like your documentation categories) for efficient file storage, maintenance, and retrieval. Document360 allows both individual and bulk folder management. Different service tiers (Professional, Business, Enterprise) are implied but not detailed.

## 346. Setting a folder as Default folder

Set a default folder for new uploads in a system by selecting it from the Drive. This setting is overridden by existing category-to-folder mappings. Default folders are indicated by an edit icon.

## 347. File limits and file type restrictions

- **File Limits**: Each folder can hold up to 5000 files, with subfolders treated as separate folders. Single file uploads are capped at **150MB**, while multiple files cannot exceed a combined size of **160MB**.
- **File Type Restrictions**: Users can restrict allowed file types by navigating to **Settings > Knowledge base portal > General > Drive settings**. They must specify media types using the format `media type/extension` and provide lowercase extensions (e.g., .png, .jpg). Multiple types can be added and changes must be saved.

## 348. Troubleshooting

The Document360 folder has a 5000-file limit, including direct uploads and images from articles or Docx files. To resolve, use another folder, delete unused files, or clear cache. Alt text for images, limited to 140 characters, aids accessibility. File upload errors may stem from unsupported types, so check settings to ensure allowed media types are selected and avoid special characters in filenames.

## 349. Starred folders

To star a folder in the drive, click the star icon next to it. Starred folders appear in a dedicated "Starred" section in the navigation, regardless of their location. Clicking the star again removes it from the starred list.

## 350. Moving a folder

To move a folder within the Drive, excluding System folders, use either the **More option** or **drag and drop**:

- **More option method**: Select folder(s), click More > Move, choose destination via search, and confirm.
- **Drag and drop method**: Drag folder to desired location in left navigation.

## 351. Renaming a folder

To rename a folder in Drive, navigate to the desired folder in the tree-view, click the More icon, select Rename, enter the new name, and confirm. Note: System folders cannot be renamed.

## 352. Change folder color

## 353. Folder breadcrumb

The breadcrumb trail in the Drive window shows the folder hierarchy, allowing navigation. Clicking on a level navigates back. Setting a folder as default multiple times has no effect. Renaming, copying, moving, or reordering folders does not change file URLs, keeping related image links intact. Folders act as categories in Document360 for organizing articles.

## 354. File actions in Drive

File actions in Google Drive are not detailed in this document. Missing data in the provided table prevents any summary of support plans for specific user groups.

## 355. Removing or deleting a folder

- For custom subfolder paths (e.g., `/help`), enter the desired path and click **Update**. Ensure subfolder hosting is enabled and configure languages for your server.
- For **KB site 2.0**, customize the Site API path (e.g., `/docs-api`) in the same tab. Both Subfolder and Site API paths must be defined for proper functionality.

> **Note**: Article preview is not supported for custom domains with subfolder hosting. Site API path is separate from API documentation.

## 856. Nginx server - Subfolder hosting

Nginx is an open-source web server that supports hosting websites in subfolders. For more details, refer to the [**Nginx documentation**](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).

## 857. Helpful Links

Nginx location blocks direct requests to different parts of your web server based on URL patterns. There are selection algorithms that determine which location block to use when matching incoming requests. See external Nginx documentation and tutorials for details about configuring and understanding these algorithms.

## 858. Sitemap generation

Configure Nginx to proxy sitemap requests to a backend server. Example uses `example.document360.io`, but replace with your domain (e.g., `your-custom-domain.com`). Supports language-specific sitemaps (e.g., `/sitemap.xml.en`). Ensures proper header forwarding for security and tracking.

## 859. What happens next?

After configuring the web server, your knowledge base is accessible via both your project's existing URL and your custom domain. This may cause duplicate content, so a redirect from the existing Document360 subdomain URL to your custom domain URL is needed. Contact support to implement this redirect.

## 860. Setting up a subfolder/subdirectory

Configure Nginx by adding location blocks for your desired subdirectory, specifying proxy_pass, headers, and sub_filter directives to rewrite URLs. For multiple workspaces, add separate blocks and redirects. Restart Nginx to apply changes.

## 861. Home page hosted on a subfolder

To host a project's home page on a custom subfolder, add Nginx configuration blocks for each workspace. Each block proxies requests to the Document360 domain and sets appropriate headers. Redirects are used for language-specific paths. After updating the configuration, restart Nginx.

**TLDR;** Configure Nginx with exact location blocks for each subfolder, proxy to Document360, set headers, handle redirects, then restart Nginx. Customization of domains, subfolders, and workspaces is required.

## 862. ASP.NET Core server

Host a knowledge base as a subfolder (`/docs`) of your main website using an ASP.NET Core server. Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Proxy` package and configure a proxy to route requests to the knowledge base's actual server (e.g., `example.document360.io`). Define both the subfolder path and the knowledge base's API path if on KB Site 2.0. Replace example domain with your specific Document360 or custom domain.

## 863. What happens next?

Duplicate content issue arises after configuring knowledge base in a custom subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/docs`). A redirect from the original site URL (`example.document360.io`) to the new subfolder URL is required. Contact `support@document360.com` to implement this redirect.

## 864. Microsoft - IIS server

Integrate knowledge base into existing website via subfolder (`/help`). Pre-requisites include Application Request Routing and URL Rewrite IIS modules. Replace example domain with your Document360 or custom domain.

## 865. Troubleshooting

TLDR of common NGINX setup issues and their solutions:

- **Invalid "location" Directive**: Ensure location blocks are within a server block. Example configuration:

```nginx
server {
listen 80;
server_name example.com;
location /docs {
      proxy_pass https://example.document360.io/docs;
      proxy_set_header Host example.document360.io;
}
}
```

- **Certbot Package Unavailable**: Enable EPEL repository and install Certbot:

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install certbot
```

- **NGINX Configuration Test Failed**: Run `sudo nginx -t`, check error messages, and fix syntax issues. Example correction:

```nginx
# Incorrect
proxy_pas https://example.com;

# Correct
proxy_pass https://example.com;
```

- **SSL Certificate Issue**: Verify certificate with OpenSSL and ensure correct NGINX configuration:

```bash
openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem -text -noout
```

Example configuration:

```nginx
server {
listen 443 ssl;
server_name yourdomain.com;
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
}
```

Each resolution includes essential steps and examples for quick troubleshooting.

## 866. What happens next?

To avoid duplicate content issues, a URL redirect is required from your original project URL (e.g., `yourcompany.document360.io`) to the custom subfolder (e.g., `yourcompany.com/help`). Contact `support@document360.com` to enable this redirect. Using a custom subfolder on your existing domain prevents duplicate content impacting search engine rankings.

## 867. Sitemap generation

Configure a web server to proxy requests for sitemap.xml files (e.g., `/sitemap.xml.en`), forwarding them to an internal or external server hosting the actual sitemap data. This hides the internal location of the sitemap file. The configuration example uses `example.document360.io` as a placeholder.

## 868. What happens next?

The knowledge base is now accessible via two URLs (project URL + custom subfolder). To avoid duplicate content issues, a URL redirect (from project URL to custom subfolder) is necessary. Contact support to enable the redirect.

## 869. Setting up a sub-folder path

To set up a sub-folder path for hosting documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Modules**:

- Install the [URL Rewrite module for IIS Server](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite).
- Install and enable the Application Request Routing (ARR) module.

2. **Configure web.config**: Add the following rewrite rules to your `web.config` file to proxy requests to your documentation:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
<system.webServer>
   <rewrite>
      <rules>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_HomePage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help$" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/v1" />
               <serverVariables>
                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
            <rule name="ReverseProxy_DocsPage" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url="^help/(.*)" />
               <action type="Rewrite" url="https://example.document360.io/help/{R:1}" />
               <serverVariables>
                  <set name="HTTP_requested_by" value="proxy" />
                  <set name="HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="{HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING}" />
                  <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
               </serverVariables>
            </rule>
      </rules>
   </rewrite>
</system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

**Important Considerations**:

- Backup your `web.config` file before making changes.
- If using KB Site 2.0, ensure you define both the Subfolder path and the Site API path.

## 870. Readers self-registration

Users can independently create reader accounts on knowledge base sites by following a self-registration process. Share the knowledge base URL. Users enter name & email, then verify the email for password set-up. Project members control reader access. Email verification is a one-time process usable across projects.

## 871. Readers self registration

The self-registration feature is available for Business and Enterprise plans when the Knowledge base site access is set to Private or Mixed.

## 872. Apache HTTP server

The Apache HTTP server is a free, open-source solution offering flexibility and customization for hosting Document360 knowledge bases as subfolders. Key steps include enabling necessary modules (proxy, headers, substitute, etc.), configuring VirtualHost for proxying and URL substitutions, setting up redirects, and restarting the server. Substitutions ensure links reflect the subfolder structure, and redirects manage URL paths seamlessly.

## 873. Accessing the Reader self-registration option

Enable reader self-registration in Document360 settings to allow users to register themselves. Configure default reader groups and/or restrict access by email domain (allow or block specific domains). Newly registered readers are added to default groups unless their domain is already assigned.

## 874. Adding a domain restriction

Configure knowledge base self-registration by domain. Specify email domains (allowing or blocking) and assign reader groups to those domains. Domain-specific settings override default reader groups.

## 875. Creating a Reviewer account

Create Reviewer accounts individually by selecting "Reviewer" in the portal role during team account creation. Bulk import is possible by using a CSV file with email addresses. Ensure correct roles (portal and content) are selected in both methods. Specify content access permissions as needed.

## 876. FAQs

- **No default reader group selected:** Self-registered readers get unrestricted access to the knowledge base.
- **Multiple group memberships:** Readers receive the highest level of access for each content item.
- **Individual vs. group access:** The highest privilege from both settings is granted to the reader.
- **Access prioritization:** The highest privilege at each content level determines access.
- **Self-registration not working with SSO:** Self-registration requires the Document360 login page, which is bypassed by SSO.

## 877. Managing reviewer accounts

The **Reviewer** role in Document360 allows users to view articles, add comments, and update workflow statuses without editing content. This role is available across Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans, providing controlled access to the Documentation module for streamlined content review.

## 878. Managing Reviewer accounts

Manage reviewer accounts in the "Team accounts & groups" section of settings. Edit/delete existing accounts, convert to/from reader accounts, and purchase reviewer add-ons through the billing section. Conversion to reader involves content access permissions selection and optional mapping to reader groups.

## 879. Reviewer role functionality

Reviewer role enables content review without editing. Reviewers access articles (in draft mode), leave comments, suggest edits, and update workflow statuses. Access is controlled (usually by category/article). Specific number of Reviewer accounts depend on plan tier (Professional: 5, Business: 10, Enterprise: 20). No direct content edits are permitted.

## 880. Account locked

Five incorrect password attempts lock an account for 30 minutes. User receives "Account locked due to multiple failed attempts! Please try again after 30 minutes" message.

## 881. Reviewer permissions and access

Reviewers have access to the Documentation module, enabling them to view articles in Draft or workflow states, add comments (inline or general), update workflow statuses, set due dates, and manage assignments. They can also perform bulk updates across multiple articles. However, they cannot add comments when an article is in Read only mode, and only one Reviewer can review an article at a time, with others notified when a Reviewer is active.

## 882. New password requirements

Password must be ≥8 characters, containing at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 special character.

## 883. Resetting your password

To reset your password, follow these steps: Click "Forgot password?", enter your email, check your inbox for the reset link, click the link, set your new password, and confirm. Password changes apply to your entire account.

## 886. Block inheritance

Block inheritance lets you override inherited content access permissions, allowing granular control over who can see specific content (like workspaces, languages, categories, articles) within a system, regardless of broader team permissions. Administrators selectively grant access to targeted accounts on a per-content-level basis. Removing inherited permissions isolates access to only the accounts explicitly added in the content access list.

## 887. IP restriction

Project-level IP restriction controls access to a knowledge base by allowing/blocking specific IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). Restrictions apply to all workspaces and languages within a project.

## 888. FAQs

Disabling inheritance restricts access to only specified team accounts and groups, and the team account performing the action is automatically selected and cannot be removed.

## 889. Allow inheritance

To enable inheritance, navigate to the desired category/article in the Documentation section, access Security settings via the More icon, toggle off **Block inherited account**, confirm by clicking **Yes**, and then close the blade. This allows inherited team accounts and groups to access the content, streamlining permission management.

**What is an IPv6 format?**\
Eight groups of hexadecimal digits, colon-separated (e.g., FE38:DCE3:124C:C1A2:BA03:6745:EF1C:683D).

**What is an IPv6 unicast address?**\
Identifies a single interface for direct communication, unlike multicast or anycast.

## 895. How does SSO work?

Single Sign-On (SSO) works through a collaboration between a **Service Provider** (e.g., Document360) and an **Identity Provider (IdP)**. When a user accesses the Service Provider, they are redirected to the IdP to authenticate using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the IdP issues an **Access/ID token**, which the Service Provider validates. This establishes a trust relationship, allowing the user to access SSO-enabled applications without additional sign-ins. Document360 supports multiple IdPs, offering flexibility for users to choose their preferred authentication method.

## 896. What is an IdP?

An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is an external entity that manages user identities and authenticates users, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) to access multiple services with one login. It stores credentials and handles logins for various applications. Each stored entity is called a **principal**. Examples include **Okta**, **Entra ID**, **Google**, **ADFS**, and **OneLogin**.

## 897. Logging in using SSO

Access the Document360 Knowledge base portal using SSO. Enter email/domain, click "Continue with SSO," authenticate via your Identity Provider (IdP) login.

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the Knowledge base portal URL.
- **Step 2:** Input your email or subdomain.
- **Step 3:** Click "Continue with SSO."
- **Step 4:** Log in to your IdP.
- **Result:** Automatically logged into the Knowledge base portal.

## 898. IdP initiated sign-in

Document360 login is possible directly from the Identity Provider (IdP) dashboard if configured. Find the Document360 app within the IdP's dashboard to initiate SSO login, bypassing the need for a separate portal visit. Uses existing SSO credentials.

## 899. SSO Standards on Document360

Document360 supports Single Sign-On (SSO) through SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect. SAML 2.0 is a robust standard enabling secure cross-application authentication, while OpenID Connect offers a modern, user-friendly alternative. Both protocols support various Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Okta, ADFS, Google, and others, with comprehensive configuration guides available for setup and removal.

## 900. Login using SSO - Knowledge base portal

SSO enables access to the Knowledge base portal using existing credentials from an identity provider, eliminating the need for multiple passwords. The document does not specify which plans (Professional, Business, Enterprise) support SSO.

## 901. Login using SSO - Knowledge base site

Document360's Knowledge base site supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to log in with their existing credentials from another identity provider (IdP), eliminating the need for separate passwords.

## 902. Logging in using SSO

Use your existing identity provider (IdP) credentials to log into the Document360 Knowledge Base. Visit the site, select your IdP's login button, log into your IdP, and you'll be automatically logged in. SSO login buttons vary based on configurations.

## 903. Troubleshooting

The HTTP 500 error during SSO login likely stems from an outdated SAML certificate or incorrect attribute mappings. Update the IdP with the latest metadata from Document360 to ensure the correct certificate is used. Verify that SAML attributes like email and name match exactly between the IdP and Document360. If issues persist, contact support for further assistance.

## 904. Adding a new team account as an SSO user

To add a new team account linked to SSO, follow the standard Document360 team account creation process in the Knowledge Base portal, but additionally: 1) Ensure the user email matches the SSO domain; 2) Select the desired SSO configuration; 3) Optionally, skip the invitation email. Only Owners/Admins can add accounts.

## 905. IdP Initiated Sign-In

## 976. Enterprise SSO using \***\*JWT\*\***

**Key Information:** Document360's JWT SSO leverages a customer application for user authentication. User logs in to customer app, which requests an auth code via backchannel from Identity Provider (using client credentials). Document360 receives the auth code and requests an ID token/access token. Document360 creates a session, automatically renewing it within a configurable timeframe (5 to 1440 minutes). No separate Document360 reader account is required (only app account). This approach is exclusive to other SSO methods (SAML, OpenID).

## 977. Removing a configured OpenID SSO

Delete an SSO configuration in Document360 by accessing the project's Knowledge base, navigating to Settings > Users & security > SAML/OpenID. Hover over the SSO configuration to reveal the Delete icon. Confirm deletion in the popup, understanding it removes associated user accounts.

## 978. SSO configuration

Configure SSO in Document360 by creating a JWT under Settings > Users & security > JWT, then copy the Client ID, Callback URL, and Client secret for your application. Enable/disable JWT SSO login, configure the login URL, and set up redirection using the `redirectUrl` parameter in the URL. Note: Client secret is only available once and must be regenerated if lost.

## 979. Setting up JWT SSO

To set up JWT-based Single Sign-On (SSO) in Document360, follow these steps:

1. **Understand JWT**: A JSON Web Token (JWT) securely transfers authentication and authorization data between applications. It consists of a header, payload, and signature.

2. **Check SSO Plan Compatibility**: Verify if your subscription plan supports SSO. While the table provided is empty, typically higher-tier plans like Enterprise include such features.

3. **Generate JWT Token**: Upon user login, generate a JWT token. Include necessary claims (e.g., user ID, email) and set an expiration time for security.

4. **Configure Secret Key**: Use a strong secret key to sign the JWT. Ensure this key is shared with Document360 for token verification.

5. **Set Up Redirect Flow**: When accessing Document360, users are redirected to your login page. Post-login, generate the JWT and redirect them back with the token.

6. **Test the Flow**: Validate the entire process, ensuring smooth user authentication without additional logins.

7. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to Document360’s API documentation for specific requirements and endpoints.

This setup enhances user convenience and security, streamlining access to Document360.

## 980. Reader groups in Document360

Document360 reader groups grant precise access to private knowledge base content. Users must log in. Groups can be created to restrict access to specific categories (e.g., sales team only sees pricing/billing). Members are then assigned to those groups.

To resolve the 401 Unauthorized error during JWT testing in Postman, follow these organized steps:

1. **Authorize the Request**:

- In Postman, navigate to the Authorization tab of your request.
- Set the authorization type to **Basic Auth**.
- Enter your **Client ID** as the Username and **Client Secret** as the Password.

2. **Verify Request Format**:

- Switch to the Body tab.
- Select **raw** and ensure the format is set to **JSON**.
- Include all required parameters, such as **grant_type**, in your JSON payload.

3. **Confirm Credentials**:

- Double-check that the Client ID and Secret are correct and properly entered.

4. **Check Endpoint URL**:

- Ensure you're using the correct token endpoint URL as specified in the documentation.

5. **Inspect Server Response**:

- If an error occurs, examine the response body for additional details that can indicate the issue, such as "invalid grant type" or "bad credentials."

6. **Review System Configuration**:

- Verify with your system administrator that the Client ID and Secret are correctly registered on the server side.

By systematically addressing each of these areas, you can identify and resolve the cause of the 401 error.

## 981. JWT reader groups

JWT reader accounts can be linked to existing Document360 reader groups, inheriting their restriction settings to control knowledge base access. These groups function like regular reader groups, with support for single sign-on (SSO) across Free, Professional, Business, and Enterprise plans.

## 982. Reader group IDs

For JWT SSO-enabled projects, Reader group IDs can be found in **Settings > Users and Security > Readers & groups**. Each reader group displays a **Group Id** below its name, with a copy icon for easy pasting into the payload. Note: Available only for JWT-configured projects, not regular private knowledge bases.

## 983. Enabling JWT reader groups

Configure JWT reader access by providing a user's details (name, email) and a list of reader group IDs in a specific JSON format. Changes to reader groups only apply after the current JWT session expires (token validity). Use comma-separated IDs in the `readerGroupIds` array. Min token validity is 5 minutes, max is 1 day.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
  setTimeout(function () {
    document.getElementById('darkTheme').click();
  }, 100);
});
```

Then save your changes.

3. **Disable Theme Switching (Optional)**: To enforce dark mode, navigate to **Settings > Knowledge base site > Customize site**, select **Dark only** under **Site theme**, and save.

This ensures dark mode is the default, with the option to prevent users from switching to light mode. The script reliably triggers dark mode if the 'darkTheme' element is present, and testing post-implementation is recommended to ensure compatibility.

Images are left-aligned by default in Markdown. Markdown lacks built-in image alignment. The document suggests a workaround, but the details are missing.

## 1002. How to add accordion in Markdown?

To add an accordion in Markdown, use HTML's `<details>` and `<summary>` tags. Wrap your content within `<details>`, use `<summary>` for the title, and place content inside `<p>`. You can include headings by using `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.

**Code Example**:

```html
<details>
  <summary><strong>Accordion Title</strong></summary>
  <p>Content here...</p>
</details>
```

**Caution**: Adding headings in the summary may affect text alignment. You can nest lists, headings, and other HTML within the content section.

## 1003. Advanced customizations for accordions

Enhance accordions with colors, dotted borders, and icons using CSS.

## 1026. How to hide the category manager?

Project-specific solution (impacting all workspaces) uses custom CSS/JS to restrict article access to specific URLs. Readers can only view articles with matching URLs . This hides the category manager.

The solution involves adding a JavaScript snippet to your Document360 Knowledge Base 1.0 site to move the related articles section above the feedback section. Here's a concise overview of the steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.
2. Under the JavaScript tab, paste the provided snippet:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  $('.content_block_text').append('<div class="sperator"><hr></div>');
  $('.related-articles-container').appendTo('.content_block_text');
};
```

3. Save the changes to implement the modification.

This script appends a separator line to the content block and moves the related articles above the feedback section.

1. Access **Settings**, navigate to **Knowledge base site** > **Customize site** > **Custom CSS & JavaScript**.
2. In the JavaScript section, paste the following code:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  $('.content_block_text').append('<div class="sperator"><hr></div>');
  $('.related-articles-container').appendTo('.content_block_text');
};
```

3. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

To hide the change password option for readers using custom CSS or JS on Business or Enterprise plans:

1. **Identify the Element**: Locate the HTML element (e.g., button or link) for the change password option. Use browser developer tools to find its class or ID.

2. **CSS Implementation**: Write CSS to hide the element. For example:

```css
.change-password-link {
  display: none;
}
```

3. **JavaScript Enhancement**: If the element is dynamically loaded, use a Mutation Observer to detect and hide it when it appears. Alternatively, remove it directly after DOM loads:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  document.querySelector('.change-password-link').remove();
});
```

4. **Consider Dynamic Content**: If the site uses AJAX, ensure your script runs after content loads or use a mutation observer for real-time changes.

5. **Test Across Scenarios**: Verify functionality across browsers, devices, and page scenarios, ensuring no accessibility issues arise.

6. **Security Note**: Hiding the UI doesn't prevent direct URL access. Consider backend restrictions for full security.

By following these steps, you can effectively hide the change password option while maintaining site functionality.
