## Search

**TLDR:** Search allows accessing tag-based content (articles, categories, files).  Use keywords in the tag search to find related items, view details (name, version, status, etc.), and remove dependencies.

## Incorrect

**TLDR:**  Configuration directive, likely a typo of `proxy_pass` intended to forward requests to `https://example.com`.

To configure a custom domain for your Document360 site, follow these steps: navigate to Settings > Knowledge base site > Custom domain, enter your desired domain, and update your DNS settings according to Document360's instructions. This involves setting a CNAME record pointing to Document360 and verifying domain ownership, possibly via a TXT record. After DNS propagation, your site will be accessible through the custom domain, enhancing your brand presence.

## Site Configuration

Configure custom domains via CNAME records; manage apex domains with DNS flattening and SSL renewal every 90 days. Set up subdirectory hosting for SEO benefits and ensure redirects to prevent duplicate content. Troubleshoot domain issues using DNS tools and CAA records. Use Nginx, ASP.NET Core, or IIS with specific configurations, and enable subfolder hosting with proper proxy settings. Contact support for necessary redirects and configurations.

## Site Configuration

**TLDR:** Apache subfolder hosting for Document360 requires configuring necessary modules (proxy, headers, substitute), setting up VirtualHost for proxying and URL substitutions, implementing redirects, and restarting the server.  This ensures correct file serving and seamless URL handling within the subfolder structure.

## User Management

User self-registration allows readers to create accounts independently by providing name and email, with a one-time email verification for password setup. Project members manage reader access. This feature is available on Business and Enterprise plans with Private or Mixed site access.

## Correct

TLDR: Configure servers for documentation hosting withSSL verification and reverse proxy setups. 

- **Nginx Configuration**: Use `proxy_pass` directive. Verify SSL certificates with OpenSSL and configure server blocks for SSL settings.

- **Subfolder Hosting**: Ensure accessibility via project URLs and custom subfolders with necessary URL redirects.

## User Management

**TLDR:** To change your password, consult the dedicated "Change password" article.

## Access Control

No information is available regarding block inheritance plan support, as the table is empty.

## Access Control

**TLDR:**  Administrators can override inherited permissions for specific content (e.g., workspaces, articles).  Access is granted on a per-content item basis, not just by user group.  This isolates access to only the explicitly authorized users for each content item.

## User Management

Document360's User Management includes configuring reader self-registration with default groups and domain restrictions, allowing email domains to control access. The Reviewer role enables content review without editing, with access to articles, comments, and workflow updates. Reviewer accounts can be created individually or via CSV import, with permissions based on categories or articles. Security features include account lockouts after 5 failed attempts, password requirements (8+ characters with mix of cases, number, and special character), and a reset process via email. Reviewer capabilities include managing assignments, bulk updates, and due dates, though they cannot edit content directly. Self-registration may not work with SSO, and the number of Reviewer accounts varies by plan (5-20). Password changes apply to the entire account to maintain security.

## Security

**TLDR:**  Manage IP access restrictions via Settings > User & Security > IP Restriction. View, add (with names & IPs/ranges), and remove IP addresses.  Allow or Block access.  Avoid duplicates for conflict prevention. Supports IPv4 & IPv6 (including specific IPv6 formats).

## Authentication

**TLDR:** SSO is a single login for multiple applications. Benefits include enhanced security, productivity, UX, simplified IT, compliance support, and cost reduction.  SSO plans aren't yet defined for Professional, Business, or Enterprise tiers.

## Access Control

Access control allows managing permissions by blocking or enabling inheritance. Blocking inheritance restricts access to only specified team accounts and groups, with the acting team account being non-removable. Enabling inheritance permits inherited team accounts and groups to access the content, simplifying permission management by toggling the "Block inherited account" setting in the Security menu.

tag needs a concise TLDR. I'll analyze the key points from the provided content regarding IP restrictions, ensuring all critical aspects are included. This includes mentioning project-level control, allowing/blocking IPs, support for IPv4 and IPv6, and its application across all workspaces and languages. I'll present this information clearly and succinctly in the output section.
</thinking>

<output>
## Security

Project-level IP restrictions control access by allowing or blocking specific IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, applying universally across all workspaces and languages within the project.

## User Management

**TLDR:** Document360 team accounts linked to SSO require a matching SSO domain email, selection of the desired SSO configuration, and optionally, skipping the invitation email. Only Owners/Admins can add these accounts.

## Authentication

Document360's SSO allows users to access its Knowledge Base portal or site using credentials from supported Identity Providers (IdPs) like Okta, Google, or ADFS via SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. Users log in by entering their email, selecting SSO, and authenticating through their IdP, eliminating the need for multiple passwords. IdP-initiated sign-in is also supported. Troubleshooting common SSO issues, such as HTTP 500 errors, involves updating SAML certificates and verifying attribute mappings.

## Security

TLDR: An IP address uniquely identifies computers/networks online. IPv4 addresses are in the format of four 0-255 numbers separated by dots (e.g., 49.206.113.170). IPv6 addresses use eight hexadecimal groups separated by colons (e.g., FE38:DCE3:124C:C1A2:BA03:6745:EF1C:683D). An IPv6 unicast address is a unique identifier for direct communication with one interface.

## Authentication

**TLDR:** Enable IdP-initiated SSO sign-in to securely access the Document360 Knowledge base directly from your IdP dashboard.

## Authentication

**TLDR:**  SSO (using SAML) prevents duplicate user accounts in projects as a reader.  If a user already exists as an SSO reader, adding them again is blocked.

## Authentication

**TLDR:**  Map existing SAML/OpenID SSO configurations to Document360 projects by selecting them from a dropdown.  Disable the Document360 login page to force SSO login (SAML/OpenID).  Existing IdP and SSO protocol type must match the chosen config.

`
## User Management

- **Inviting SSO Users:** Configure Enterprise SSO using SAML or OpenID Connect, then invite users via email or add them directly through identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace.
- **Deleting SSO Users:** Navigate to Team accounts & groups, select the SSO user, click "Delete", and confirm. Note that deleting an SSO user does not remove the associated team account.
`

## User Management

To invite existing users to login via SSO in Document360, follow these steps: log in, navigate to **Settings > Users & Security > SAML/OpenID**, edit the SSO configuration, select **All users** or **Selected users only**, and save. Users receive an invitation email, and an additional SSO account is created alongside their existing one.

## User Management

To automatically assign SSO readers in Document360, configure SAML or OpenID settings in the project's "Users & security" section. Enable the "Auto assign reader group" option and select existing reader groups. Ensure reader groups are created beforehand.

## User Management

**TLDR:** Document360 accounts can be converted to SSO accounts for single sign-on, simplifying login.  This conversion is SAML/OpenID exclusive, and previous contributions become anonymous.  Auto-assignment of reader groups for SSO users automates access control.  Conversion is irreversible, and JWT projects aren't supported.  Owners become both Document360 and SSO accounts. Accidental SSO conversions require manual account recreation.

tag, print a markdown heading "## Authentication," and provide a concise TLDR of the given document. I need to focus on key information while keeping it brief.

The document discusses disabling the default login for organizations using SSO, redirecting users to SSO login. It's available in certain plans, but the exact plans aren't specified. There's a caution about mixing SSO and regular accounts, as it might lock out regular users.

So, the TLDR should mention the feature, its applicability, the redirect, the plan support, and the warning about regular user access.
</thinking>

<output>
## Authentication

Organizations using only SSO users can disable the Document360 login page, redirecting users to the SSO login. This feature is supported in certain plans. However, if both SSO and regular accounts are present, disabling the login page may prevent regular users from accessing their accounts.

## Authentication

Document360 supports various SSO methods (SAML, OpenID Connect, JWT) using multiple IdPs (Okta, Entra, Google, ADFS, etc.).  Key configurations involve obtaining IdP details (certificates, URLs), mapping attributes, enabling/disabling IdP-initiated login, custom settings (idle timeout, login button), and handling various integration scenarios.  Troubleshooting advice and FAQs are included.  JWT SSO is a separate flow, leveraging a customer application to handle authentication. Deleting an SSO configuration removes associated users.

## Authentication

**TLDR:** JWT reader accounts in Document360 leverage existing reader groups for knowledge base access control, inheriting restriction settings and supporting single sign-on (SSO) across all plans (Free, Professional, Business, Enterprise).

## User Management

**TLDR:**  Reader group IDs for JWT SSO projects are accessible in Settings > Users and Security > Readers & groups.  Each group has a visible ID with a copy function.  This is only applicable to JWT-configured projects, not standard private knowledge bases.

## User Management

Resolve the 401 Unauthorized error in JWT testing by verifying authorization settings, credentials, request format, and server configuration.

## Site Customization

**TLDR:** Customize knowledge base site's search highlights, hide workspaces dropdown, adjust hyperlink color in dark mode, and enlarge PDF previews by modifying site-specific CSS.

* **Search Highlights:** Change `background-color` and `color` in KB Site 1.0/2.0 Custom CSS.
* **Hide Workspace Dropdown:** Add CSS rule `header .header_bottom .header_bottom_nav ul li.versions-selection { display: none; }` to custom CSS.
* **Dark Mode Hyperlinks:**  Customize hyperlink color in Dark mode Custom CSS.
* **Enlarge PDF Previews:** Adjust PDF container width  in Custom CSS to enlarge preview.

## Authentication

Configure JWT-based authentication by providing user details (name, email) and reader group IDs in a specific JSON format. Changes to reader groups take effect after the current JWT session expires. Tokens are valid for a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 1 day. Reader group IDs must be provided as a comma-separated list.

## Content Formatting

*No summary available for this section.*



## Site Customization

**TLDR:**  Customize table borders by adding CSS (adjust thickness/color). Prevent content copying by intercepting copy/cut/paste events using JavaScript on specific HTML elements (`content_block`, `d360-article-content`).  Adjust CSS/JS settings for desired results on tables and selected content areas.  Mitigation, not complete prevention.

## Content Formatting

**TLDR:**  To center headings or text, or change text color in Markdown, use HTML `<hN style="text-align:center;">` for headings, `<p style="text-align:center;">` for paragraphs, and `<span style="color:desiredColor;">` for inline text formatting.  Markdown itself doesn't support these directly.

## Content Enhancement

TLDR: To set default PDF dimensions, add a CSS snippet to your knowledge base site's CSS settings, specifying desired height and width in pixels.

## Site Customization

**TLDR:** Customize your Knowledge Base site using custom CSS and JavaScript.  Change code block language names, center headings, alter table header colors, and modify callout colors (especially in dark mode).  Custom CSS targets elements like `table th`, `H2`,  `.infoBox`; custom JavaScript automatically applies dark mode initially, disabling further theme switching is possible.  Follow the provided steps in the document for specific changes and element targeting.

## Site Customization

**TLDR:** Customize your knowledge base site with advanced accordion styling, background images on text, sortable tables, new tab links, and customizable table of contents via CSS & JavaScript.  Use provided code snippets, adjusting image URLs and colors as needed, to target specific HTML elements.  Essential to finding the right HTML selectors in your site framework.

## Content Enhancement

**TLDR:** Document360 will now use a default featured image for knowledge base articles, replacing any missing image.  This default image must be publicly accessible and ensures consistent thumbnails on social media shares.

## Site Customization

**TLDR:**  Enterprise users can increase hyperlink size by adding custom CSS to a Knowledge Base Site.  Add CSS to adjust `font-size` in a specific class.  Apply this class to `a` (anchor) tags to affect hyperlink size.  Adjust value and save changes.

## Content Formatting

**TLDR:**  To add borders to images in Markdown, use HTML's `style` attribute within the `<img>` tag.  Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="description" style="border: 2px solid grey;">`.  Adjust border width, style (e.g., solid, dashed), and color as needed.

## Content Formatting

- Use `<br>` for vertical line breaks and `&nbsp;` for horizontal space between words in Markdown.
